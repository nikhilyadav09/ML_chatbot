1,what-is-machine-learning,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-machine-learning/,"Machine Learning, as the name says, is all about machines learning automatically without being explicitly programmed or learning without any direct human intervention. This machine learning process starts with feeding them good quality data and then training the machines by building various machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate. As for the formal definition of Machine Learning, we can say that a Machine Learning algorithm learns from experience E with respect to some type of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. For example, If a Machine Learning algorithm is used to play chess. Then the experience E is playing many games of chess, the task T is playing chess with many players, and the performance measure P is the probability that the algorithm will win in the game of chess.","

**Machine Learning**

Machine Learning is a process where machines learn automatically without explicit programming or human intervention. The process begins by feeding high-quality data into the machine, followed by training the machine using various machine learning models and algorithms. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data and the task being automated.

**Formal Definition**

A Machine Learning algorithm learns from experience (E) with respect to a specific task (T) and performance measure (P), if its performance on tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

**Example**

For instance, if a Machine Learning algorithm is used to play chess, the experience E would be playing many games of chess, the task T would be playing chess with multiple players, and the performance measure P would be the probability of the algorithm winning a game of chess.

**Handling Missing Data**

Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets, occurring due to various reasons such as human errors, system failures, or data collection issues. To handle missing data, various techniques can be employed, including imputation, deletion, or substitution.

**Calculating Percentage of Missing Values**

To calculate the percentage of missing values, we can use the `df.isnull()` function to check whether the values are null or not, and then use the `.sum()` function to sum the total number of null values per row. We can then divide the sum by the total number of rows in the dataset and multiply by 100 to get the percentage of missing values.

**Output**

The output shows that missing observations cannot be ignored or removed. Instead, they must be handled carefully, as they can be an indication of something important. Dropping observations with missing values may not be a suitable solution, as the fact that a value was missing may be informative in itself. In the real world, predictions often need to be made on new data, even if some features are missing.

**Handling Missing Values in the Titanic Dataset**

In the Titanic dataset, we can see that the `Cabin` column has 77% null values, while the `Age` column has 19.87% null values, and the `Embarked` column has 0.22% null values. Dropping the `Cabin` column is not a good idea, as it may be informative. Instead, we can drop the null values rows in the `Embarked` column.

**Imputing Missing Values**

Imputing missing values from past observations is another approach. However, missingness is often informative in itself, and it's essential to tell the algorithm if a value was missing. Even if we build a model to impute values, we're not adding any real information; we're just reinforcing patterns already provided by other features.

**Choosing an Imputation Method**

We can use either Mean imputation or Median imputation for imputing missing values. Mean imputation is suitable when the data is normally distributed and has no extreme outliers. Median imputation is preferable when the data contains outliers or is skewed.

The code begins by loading the iris dataset from the sklearn.datasets library and splitting it into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. A Decision Tree Classifier model is then trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics. The code provides a comprehensive analysis of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as a visual representation of the confusion matrix."

This is the most fundamental metric used to evaluate the model. The formula is given by However, Accuracy has a drawback. It cannot perform well on an imbalanced dataset.

But in general, the model cannot classify on minor class labels and has poor performance. Output:"," Accuracy**

Accuracy is a fundamental metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. The formula is:

Accuracy = (Number of correct predictions) / (Total number of predictions)

**Limitations of Accuracy**

However, Accuracy has a significant drawback. It is not suitable for evaluating models on imbalanced datasets. In an imbalanced dataset, one class label has a significantly larger number of instances than the others. When a model is trained on such a dataset, it tends to perform well on the majority class label and poorly on the minority class labels. This is because the model is biased towards the majority class, resulting in higher accuracy but poor performance on the minority class labels.

**Recall**

Recall is another important metric that evaluates a model's ability to identify all true positives, calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the proportion of actual positive samples that are correctly identified. While recall is useful, it can lead to a higher false positive rate, as it prioritizes detecting all positive instances over minimizing false positives.

2. **Computational Resources**: Training deep learning models is computationally expensive, requiring specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This can lead to lengthy processing times, potentially taking days or months to complete.

3. **Interpretability**: Deep learning models are inherently complex, functioning like a ""black box."" It is challenging to interpret the results, making it difficult to understand the underlying decision-making processes.

4. **Overfitting**: When a model is repeatedly trained on the same data, it becomes overly specialized, leading to overfitting and poor performance on new, unseen data. This can result in decreased accuracy and reliability.

The answer is simple, the more you want to inherit features from a pre-trained model, the more you have to freeze layers. The extent to which you inherit features from a pre-trained model depends on the size and similarity of the target dataset to the original dataset: Small and Similar Target Dataset: When the dataset is limited but similar to the base dataset, fine-tuning only a few layers may lead to overfitting. In this case, the last one or two fully connected layers are removed and replaced with a new layer that fits the target classes. The rest of the model is frozen, and only the newly added layers are trained. Large and Similar Target Dataset: If the target dataset is large and similar, overfitting is less likely. The last fully connected layer is removed, replaced to match the new classes, and the entire model is fine-tuned on the new dataset, preserving the architecture while adapting to the larger dataset. Small and Different Target Dataset: When the target dataset is small and distinct, the high-level features from the original model are less useful. Here, remove most of the top layers, add new layers to accommodate the target classes, and train from these lower layers onward to fit the unique dataset. Large and Different Target Dataset: For large and distinct datasets, the model benefits most from removing the final layers and adding new layers tailored to the new task.

* **Small and Similar Target Dataset**: When the target dataset is limited but similar to the base dataset, fine-tuning only a few layers may lead to overfitting.

227,collaborative-learning-federated-learning,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collaborative-learning-federated-learning/?ref=next_article,"There are various strategies that are used for Federated Learning. Lets take a brief look at them. Centralized Federated Learning: In this, a central server is used to perform different steps of the algorithm. The central system is subjected to selecting the nodes at the beginning of the training process and then it is also responsible for aggregating the model updates that we received from different nodes/devices. Here, all the selected nodes, send the updates to this central server and hence it is the bottleneck of the system. This method can cause bottleneck problems. Decentralized Federated Learning: In this, the nodes themselves can coordinate to get the updated model. This approach can help in preventing the single server problems, that we can get from the centralized federated learning, as in this the model updates are shared between the interconnected nodes without the need of the central system. Here, the models performance is totally dependent on what network topology we opt for. Heterogeneous Federated Learning: This learning involves a large no of heterogenous clients e.g., mobile devices, and IoT devices. These devices can differ in software or hardware configurations. Recently, a Federated learning framework called HeteroFL has emerged, specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by heterogeneous clients with varying computation and communication capabilities.","rning Strategies**

Federated learning is a distributed approach to machine learning that enables multiple devices or nodes to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their individual data. There are three primary strategies used in federated learning: Centralized, Decentralized, and Heterogeneous.

**Centralized Federated Learning**

In this approach, a central server is responsible for performing various steps of the algorithm, including selecting nodes at the beginning of the training process and aggregating model updates received from different nodes or devices. All selected nodes send their updates to the central server, which can become a bottleneck in the system, potentially causing performance issues.

**Decentralized Federated Learning**

In decentralized federated learning, nodes coordinate with each other to obtain updated models. This approach helps prevent single-server problems, as model updates are shared between interconnected nodes without the need for a central system. The performance of the model depends on the chosen network topology.

**Heterogeneous Federated Learning**

Heterogeneous federated learning involves a large number of heterogeneous clients, such as mobile devices and IoT devices, which can differ in software or hardware configurations. Recently, a federated learning framework called HeteroFL has been developed to address the challenges posed by heterogeneous clients with varying computation and communication capabilities.

The base model is stored at the central server, and a copy of this model is stored on all devices. Whenever the user enters some information, the following step takes place: Step 1: The particular device will download the current model. Step 2: The model would make improvements from the new data that we got from the device. Step 3: The model changes are summarized as an update and communicated to the cloud. This communication is encrypted. Step 4: On the cloud, there are many updates coming in from multiple users. These all updates are aggregated and the final model is built. So, there is no huge amount of data being uploaded to the cloud and also the model is trained with the different data. In this process, the trained data resides within your own smartphone/mobile device.","ing: A Step-by-Step Explanation

The federated learning process begins with a central server storing the base model, which is replicated on all devices. When a user interacts with the system, the following steps occur:

1. **Model Download**: The device downloads the current model from the central server.

2. **Local Model Updates**: The model is updated using new data collected from the device.

3. **Update Summarization and Encryption**: The model updates are summarized and encrypted before being transmitted to the cloud.

4. **Cloud Aggregation**: Multiple updates from various users are aggregated on the cloud, and a final model is built.

**Causes:**

* Insufficient training time
* Limited model complexity
* Inadequate feature representation
* High regularization parameters

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase training time**: Allow the model to learn from the data for a longer period to improve its generalization capabilities.
2. **Enhance model complexity**: Increase the model's capacity to learn complex relationships by adding more layers, neurons, or features.
3. **Add more features to the data**: Incorporate additional relevant features to the dataset to provide the model with more information to learn from.
4. **Reduce regularization parameters**: Decrease the regularization strength to allow the model to learn from the data without being overly constrained.

It is like trying to fit in Oversized jeans. Unfortunately, this is one of the significant issues faced by machine learning professionals. This means that the algorithm is trained with noisy and biased data, which will affect its overall performance. Lets understand this with the help of an example. Lets consider a model trained to differentiate between a cat, a rabbit, a dog, and a tiger. The training data contains 1000 cats, 1000 dogs, 1000 tigers, and 4000 Rabbits. Then there is a considerable probability that it will identify the cat as a rabbit. In this example, we had a vast amount of data, but it was biased; hence the prediction was negatively affected. We can tackle this issue by: Analyzing the data with the utmost level of perfection Use data augmentation technique Remove outliers in the training set Select a model with lesser features To know more, you can visit here.","a common issue in machine learning where a model trained on a large amount of data exhibits poor performance. This phenomenon is analogous to trying to fit into oversized jeans, where the model becomes overly specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data.

One of the primary causes of overfitting is the presence of noisy and biased data in the training set. This can occur when the data is not representative of the underlying distribution or when there are errors or inconsistencies in the data. For instance, consider a model trained to classify images of cats, dogs, tigers, and rabbits. If the training data consists of 1000 cats, 1000 dogs, 1000 tigers, and 4000 rabbits, the model may become biased towards identifying cats as rabbits due to the overwhelming presence of rabbit images.

To mitigate overfitting, machine learning professionals can employ various strategies, including:

1. Data analysis: Conducting a thorough analysis of the training data to identify and remove any errors, inconsistencies, or biases.
2. Data augmentation: Generating additional training data by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping, or color jittering, to increase the diversity of the training set.
3. Outlier removal: Identifying and removing any outliers or anomalies in the training data that may be skewing the model's performance.
4. Model selection: Choosing a model with fewer features or a simpler architecture to reduce the risk of overfitting.

By understanding the causes and consequences of overfitting, machine learning professionals can take proactive steps to prevent or mitigate this issue and develop more accurate and reliable models.

Introduction to Machine Learning A subset of artificial intelligence known as machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to independently learn from data and previous experiences. Arthur Samuel first used the term ""machine learning"" in 1959.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves training an algorithm on unlabeled data, where the algorithm must discover patterns, relationships, or structure within the data on its own. This type of learning is useful for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is a type of learning that involves training an algorithm to make decisions in an environment where the algorithm receives rewards or penalties for its actions.

**Machine Learning**

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed. It allows a computer system to make predictions or take decisions using historical data without requiring manual intervention.

Machine learning models utilize large amounts of structured and semi-structured data to generate accurate results or make predictions. These models work on algorithms that learn from historical data, adapting to new information and refining their performance over time.

Machine learning is domain-specific, meaning it is designed to work within specific areas of expertise. For instance, a machine learning model trained to detect pictures of dogs will only provide results for dog images and may become unresponsive when presented with new data, such as a cat image.

Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries, including:

* Online recommender systems
* Google search algorithms
* Email spam filters
* Facebook's auto-friend tagging suggestions
* And many more

Machine learning can be categorized into three primary types:

1. **Supervised Learning**: In this type, the machine learning model is trained on labeled data to learn the relationship between input and output.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: This type involves training the machine learning model through trial and error, where the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

**Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled datasets, where the model learns to recognize patterns and relationships between input data and corresponding output labels. The training process involves feeding the model a dataset, where each example is paired with a target output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the error between its predictions and the actual labels.

The test dataset is used to validate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The model's predictions are compared to the actual labels, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate its performance.

**Example and Diagram**

To illustrate the concept of supervised learning, consider a dataset of shapes, including squares, rectangles, triangles, and polygons. The goal is to train a model to classify new shapes into one of these categories.

1. **Training**: The model is trained on the labeled dataset, where each shape is paired with its corresponding label (e.g., ""square"" for a shape with four equal sides).
2. **Testing**: The trained model is evaluated on a test set, which includes new, unseen shapes. The model predicts the shape category for each test example.
3. **Prediction**: The model uses its learned patterns and relationships to classify the new shapes based on their characteristics, such as the number of sides. The predicted output is compared to the actual label to evaluate the model's performance.

In this example, the machine learning model is trained to recognize patterns in shapes and make predictions about new, unseen shapes. The model's ability to accurately classify shapes is a result of its training on a labeled dataset and its ability to generalize to new data."

With the help of a suitable algorithm, the model will train itself and divide the fruits into different groups according to the most similar features between them. The main differences between Supervised and Unsupervised learning are given below:","Learning**

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning method that infers patterns from unlabeled input data. The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to discover the underlying structure and patterns within the input data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not require any external supervision. Instead, it relies on its own algorithms to identify patterns and relationships within the data.

**Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems**

Unsupervised learning can be applied to two primary types of problems:

1. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points into clusters based on their characteristics.
2. **Association**: Identifying relationships between variables or data points.

**Example**

To illustrate unsupervised learning, consider the following example. Unlike supervised learning, where a model is provided with labeled data and a target output, unsupervised learning does not require any supervision. Instead, a model is trained on an input dataset, and it is left to find patterns and relationships within the data. Using a suitable algorithm, the model can group fruits into different categories based on their most similar features.

More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such astemperature, age, salary, price,etc. We can understand the concept of regression analysis using the below example: Example:Suppose there is a marketing company A, who does various advertisement every year and get sales on that. The below list shows the advertisement made by the company in the last 5 years and the corresponding sales: Now, the company wants to do the advertisement of $200 in the year 2019and wants to know the prediction about the sales for this year.

**Regression Analysis**

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent (target) variable and one or more independent (predictor) variables. It helps to understand how the value of the dependent variable changes in response to an independent variable, while holding other independent variables constant. Regression analysis predicts continuous or real values, such as temperature, age, salary, and price.

**Example**

Consider a marketing company, A, that conducts various advertisements each year and tracks the corresponding sales. The company wants to predict sales for the year 2019, given an advertisement budget of $200. To solve such prediction problems in machine learning, regression analysis is employed.

**Regression as a Supervised Learning Technique**

Regression is a supervised learning technique that finds the correlation between variables and enables the prediction of a continuous output variable based on one or more predictor variables. It is primarily used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.

**Regression Plot**

In regression, a graph is plotted between the variables, which best fits the given data points. This plot enables the machine learning model to make predictions about the data. In simple terms, regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the data points on the target-predictor graph, minimizing the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line. The distance between the data points and the line indicates whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not.

**Dependent Variable**

The dependent variable, also referred to as the target variable, is the primary factor in regression analysis that we aim to predict or understand.

**Independent Variable**

The independent variables, also known as predictors, are the factors that affect the dependent variable or are used to predict its values.

**Outliers**

An outlier is an observation that exhibits an unusually low or high value compared to other observed values. Outliers can negatively impact the results and should be avoided or addressed accordingly.

**Multicollinearity**

Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other, rather than with other variables. This condition should be avoided, as it can create issues when ranking the most influential variables.

**Underfitting and Overfitting**

Overfitting occurs when an algorithm performs well on the training dataset but poorly on the test dataset. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when an algorithm fails to perform well even on the training dataset.

In linear regression, different values for the weights or coefficients of lines (a0, a1) yield distinct regression lines. The cost function is used to estimate the optimal values of these coefficients for the best-fit line. The cost function optimizes the regression coefficients or weights by measuring how well a linear regression model performs.

For linear regression, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function is commonly used. MSE is the average of the squared errors between predicted and actual values.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE) Cost Function**

The MSE cost function can be calculated as:

MSE = (1/N) \* Σ(Yi - (a1xi + a0))^2

where:

* N is the total number of observations
* Yi is the actual value
* (a1xi + a0) is the predicted value
* Σ denotes the sum over all observations

**Residuals**

The distance between the actual value and the predicted value is called the residual. If the observed points are far from the regression line, the residual is high, and the cost function is high. Conversely, if the scatter points are close to the regression line, the residual is small, and the cost function is low.

**Assumptions of Linear Regression**

To ensure accurate results from a Linear Regression model, the following assumptions must be met:

1. **Linear Relationship**: The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

2. **No Multicollinearity**: The model assumes that there is no high correlation between the independent variables (features). Multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine which predictor variable is affecting the target variable and which is not.

3. **Homoscedasticity**: The model assumes that the error term is constant across all values of the independent variables. This means that there should be no clear pattern in the distribution of data in a scatter plot.

4. **Normal Distribution of Error Terms**: The model assumes that the error terms follow a normal distribution pattern. If the error terms are not normally distributed, confidence intervals may become too wide or too narrow, making it difficult to find coefficients.

5. **No Autocorrelation**: The model assumes that there is no correlation between the error terms. Autocorrelation can occur if there is a dependency between residual errors, which can drastically reduce the accuracy of the model.

The goals of this problem is: We want to find out if there is any correlation between these two variablesWe will find the best fit line for the dataset.How the dependent variable is changing by changing the independent variable. In this section, we will create a Simple Linear Regression model to find out the best fitting line for representing the relationship between these two variables. To implement the Simple Linear regression model in machine learning using Python, we need to follow the below steps: Step-1: Data Pre-processing The first step for creating the Simple Linear Regression model isdata pre-processing. We have already done it earlier in this tutorial. But there will be some changes, which are given in the below steps: First, we will import the three important libraries, which will help us for loading the dataset, plotting the graphs, and creating the Simple Linear Regression model. Next, we will load the dataset into our code: By executing the above line of code (ctrl+ENTER), we can read the dataset on our Spyder IDE screen by clicking on the variable explorer option. The above output shows the dataset, which has two variables: Salary and Experience. After that, we need to extract the dependent and independent variables from the given dataset. The independent variable is years of experience, and the dependent variable is salary. Below is code for it: In the above lines of code, for x variable, we have taken -1 value since we want to remove the last column from the dataset. For y variable, we have taken 1 value as a parameter, since we want to extract the second column and indexing starts from the zero. By executing the above line of code, we will get the output for X and Y variable as: In the above output image, we can see the X (independent) variable and Y (dependent) variable has been extracted from the given dataset. Next, we will split both variables into the test set and training set. We have 30 observations, so we will take 20 observations for the training set and 10 observations for the test set. We are splitting our dataset so that we can train our model using a training dataset and then test the model using a test dataset. The code for this is given below: By executing the above code, we will get x-test, x-train and y-test, y-train dataset. Consider the below images: Test-dataset: Training Dataset: For simple linear Regression, we will not use Feature Scaling. Because Python libraries take care of it for some cases, so we don't need to perform it here. Now, our dataset is well prepared to work on it and we are going to start building a Simple Linear Regression model for the given problem. Step-2: Fitting the Simple Linear Regression to the Training Set: Now the second step is to fit our model to the training dataset. To do so, we will import theLinearRegressionclass of thelinear_modellibrary from thescikit learn. After importing the class, we are going to create an object of the class named as aregressor. The code for this is given below: In the above code, we have used afit()method to fit our Simple Linear Regression object to the training set. In the fit() function, we have passed the x_train and y_train, which is our training dataset for the dependent and an independent variable. We have fitted our regressor object to the training set so that the model can easily learn the correlations between the predictor and target variables. After executing the above lines of code, we will get the below output. Output: Step: 3. Prediction of test set result: dependent (salary) and an independent variable (Experience). So, now, our model is ready to predict the output for the new observations. In this step, we will provide the test dataset (new observations) to the model to check whether it can predict the correct output or not. We will create a prediction vectory_pred, andx_pred, which will contain predictions of test dataset, and prediction of training set respectively. On executing the above lines of code, two variables named y_pred and x_pred will generate in the variable explorer options that contain salary predictions for the training set and test set. Output: You can check the variable by clicking on the variable explorer option in the IDE, and also compare the result by comparing values from y_pred and y_test. By comparing these values, we can check how good our model is performing. Step: 4. visualizing the Training set results: Now in this step, we will visualize the training set result. To do so, we will use the scatter() function of the pyplot library, which we have already imported in the pre-processing step. Thescatter () functionwill create a scatter plot of observations. In the x-axis, we will plot the Years of Experience of employees and on the y-axis, salary of employees. In the function, we will pass the real values of training set, which means a year of experience x_train, training set of Salaries y_train, and color of the observations. Here we are taking a green color for the observation, but it can be any color as per the choice. Now, we need to plot the regression line, so for this, we will use theplot() functionof the pyplot library. In this function, we will pass the years of experience for training set, predicted salary for training set x_pred, and color of the line. Next, we will give the title for the plot. So here, we will use thetitle()function of thepyplotlibrary and pass the name (""Salary vs Experience (Training Dataset)"". After that, we will assign labels for x-axis and y-axis usingxlabel() and ylabel() function. Finally, we will represent all above things in a graph using show(). The code is given below: Output: By executing the above lines of code, we will get the below graph plot as an output. In the above plot, we can see the real values observations in green dots and predicted values are covered by the red regression line. The regression line shows a correlation between the dependent and independent variable. The good fit of the line can be observed by calculating the difference between actual values and predicted values. But as we can see in the aboveplot, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence our model is good for the training set. Step: 5. visualizing the Test set results: In the previous step, we have visualized the performance of our model on the training set. Now, we will do the same for the Test set. The complete code will remain the same as the above code, except in this, we will use x_test, and y_test instead of x_train and y_train. Here we are also changing the color of observations and regression line to differentiate between the two plots, but it is optional. Output: By executing the above line of code, we will get the output as: In the above plot, there are observations given by the blue color, and prediction is given by the red regression line. As we can see, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence we can say our Simple Linear Regression is a good model and able to make good predictions.","ment for Simple Linear Regression**

The problem statement involves analyzing a dataset with two variables: salary (dependent variable) and experience (independent variable). The goal is to determine if there is a correlation between these two variables and to find the best fit line for the dataset. This will help us understand how the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes.

**Step 1: Data Pre-processing**

1. Import the necessary libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn.linear_model`.
2. Load the dataset into the code.
3. Extract the dependent and independent variables from the dataset. In this case, the independent variable is years of experience, and the dependent variable is salary.
4. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. In this case, we will use 20 observations for the training set and 10 observations for the test set.

**Step 2: Fitting the Simple Linear Regression to the Training Set**

1. Import the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` library.
2. Create an object of the `LinearRegression` class named `regressor`.
3. Use the `fit()` method to fit the model to the training set. Pass the `x_train` and `y_train` variables as arguments to the `fit()` method.

**Step 3: Prediction of Test Set Results**

1. Use the `predict()` method to predict the output for the test set.
2. Create a prediction vector `y_pred` and `x_pred` to store the predicted values for the test set and training set, respectively.

**Step 4: Visualizing the Training Set Results**

1. Use the `scatter()` function to create a scatter plot of the training set observations.
2. Plot the real values of the training set using green dots.
3. Plot the regression line using the `plot()` function.
4. Add a title to the plot using the `title()` function.
5. Add labels to the x-axis and y-axis using the `xlabel()` and `ylabel()` functions.
6. Display the plot using the `show()` function.

**Step 5: Visualizing the Test Set Results**

1. Use the same code as Step 4, but replace `x_train` and `y_train` with `x_test`"

Below are the main steps of deploying the MLR model: Data Pre-processing StepsFitting the MLR model to the training setPredicting the result of the test set Step-1: Data Pre-processing Step: The very first step isdata pre-processing, which we have already discussed in this tutorial. This process contains the below steps: Importing libraries:Firstly we will import the library which will help in building the model. Below is the code for it: Importing dataset:Now we will import the dataset(50_CompList), which contains all the variables. Below is the code for it: Output:We will get the dataset as: In above output, we can clearly see that there are five variables, in which four variables are continuous and one is categorical variable. Extracting dependent and independent Variables: Output: Out5: As we can see in the above output, the last column contains categorical variables which are not suitable to apply directly for fitting the model. So we need to encode this variable. Encoding Dummy Variables: As we have one categorical variable (State), which cannot be directly applied to the model, so we will encode it. To encode the categorical variable into numbers, we will use theLabelEncoderclass. But it is not sufficient because it still has some relational order, which may create a wrong model. So in order to remove this problem, we will useOneHotEncoder, which will create the dummy variables. Below is code for it: Here we are only encoding one independent variable, which is state as other variables are continuous. Output: As we can see in the above output, the state column has been converted into dummy variables (0 and 1).Here each dummy variable column is corresponding to the one State. We can check by comparing it with the original dataset. The first column corresponds to theCalifornia State, the second column corresponds to theFlorida State, and the third column corresponds to theNew York State. Now, we are writing a single line of code just to avoid the dummy variable trap: If we do not remove the first dummy variable, then it may introduce multicollinearity in the model. As we can see in the above output image, the first column has been removed. Now we will split the dataset into training and test set. The code for this is given below: The above code will split our dataset into a training set and test set. Output:The above code will split the dataset into training set and test set. You can check the output by clicking on the variable explorer option given in Spyder IDE. The test set and training set will look like the below image: Test set: Training set:","ing Regression (MLR) Problem**

To implement MLR using Python, we have a problem statement:

**Problem Description**

We have a dataset of 50 start-up companies, containing five main variables: R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, State, and Profit for a financial year. Our goal is to create a model that can easily determine which company has the maximum profit and which factor has the most significant impact on a company's profit. Since we need to predict the Profit, it is the dependent variable, and the other four variables are independent variables.

**MLR Model Deployment Steps**

1. **Data Pre-processing Steps**
	* Importing libraries
	* Importing dataset
	* Output: Dataset with five variables (four continuous and one categorical)
	* Extracting dependent and independent variables
	* Encoding dummy variables for categorical variables
2. **Fitting the MLR Model to the Training Set**
	* Code for fitting the model
3. **Predicting the Result of the Test Set**
	* Code for predicting the result

**Data Pre-processing Steps**

1. **Importing Libraries**

We will import the necessary libraries to build the model.

**Code**
```python
import library_name
```
2. **Importing Dataset**

We will import the dataset (50_CompList) containing all the variables.

**Code**
```python
import dataset_name
```
**Output**

The dataset will be displayed with five variables: four continuous and one categorical.

3. **Extracting Dependent and Independent Variables**

We will extract the dependent and independent variables from the dataset.

**Output**

The last column contains the categorical variable, which needs to be encoded.

4. **Encoding Dummy Variables**

We will encode the categorical variable (State) using the LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder classes.

**Code**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder

# Encode categorical variable
encoder = LabelEncoder()
state_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(state)

# Create dummy variables
one_hot_encoder = OneHotEncoder()
state_dummy = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(state_encoded)
```
**Output**

The state column will be converted into dummy variables (0 and 1), with each dummy variable column corresponding to a state.

5. **Splitting the Dataset into Training and Test Sets**

We will split the dataset into a training set and test set using the `train_test_split`"

**Output**

The output displays the predicted result set and test set. We can evaluate the model's performance by comparing these two values index by index. For instance, the first index has a predicted value of $103,015 and a test/real value of $103,282, resulting in a difference of $267. This is a good prediction, indicating that our model is complete.

**Model Accuracy**

We can also evaluate the model's accuracy using the following code:

```
[Insert code here]

**Output**

The output displays the model's accuracy for both the training dataset and test dataset. Specifically, the score indicates that our model is 95% accurate with the training dataset and 93% accurate with the test dataset.

Firstly we will create a new feature vectorx_opt, which will only contain a set of independent features that are significantly affecting the dependent variable.Next, as per the Backward Elimination process, we need to choose a significant level(0.5), and then need to fit the model with all possible predictors. So for fitting the model, we will create aregressor_OLSobject of new classOLSofstatsmodelslibrary.

Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see in the output image, now five variables remain. In these variables, the highest p-value is 0.961. So we will remove it in the next iteration.

In this chapter, we will use the same model built in the previous chapter of Machine Learning Regression (MLR). The code for the model is provided below.

**Step 1: Preparation of Backward Elimination**

To begin, we need to import the `statsmodels.formula.api` library, which is used for estimating various statistical models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

**Adding a Constant Term**

In our MLR equation, there is a constant term `b0`, but this term is not present in our matrix of features. Therefore, we need to add it manually. We will add a column with values `x0 = 1` associated with the constant term `b0`. This can be done using the `numpy` library and the `append` function.

**Step 2: Backward Elimination Process**

Now, we will apply the backward elimination process. First, we will create a new feature vector `x_opt`, which will contain only the independent features that significantly affect the dependent variable. Next, we will choose a significant level (0.5) and fit the model with all possible predictors using the `OLS` class from the `statsmodels` library.

**Fitting the Model and Selecting Variables**

We will use the `fit` method to fit the model and the `summary` method to obtain a summary table of all the values. The summary table will provide the p-values for each variable. We will choose the variable with the highest p-value and remove it from the table, refitting the model in each iteration.

**Removing Variables**

In the first iteration, we will remove the variable `x1` (dummy variable) since its p-value is greater than the significant level. In the next iteration, we will remove `x2` (dummy variable) since its p-value is also greater than the significant level. We will continue this process until only the significant variables remain.

**Final Model**

After removing all the non-significant variables, we will be left with only two variables: `x3` (R&D spend) and `x5` (Marketing spend). Therefore, only the R&D independent variable is a significant variable for prediction, and we can use it to make efficient predictions.

The code for pre-processing step is given below: Explanation: In the above lines of code, we have imported the important Python libraries to import dataset and operate on it.Next, we have imported the dataset 'Position_Salaries.csv', which contains three columns (Position, Levels, and Salary), but we will consider only two columns (Salary and Levels).After that, we have extracted the dependent(Y) and independent variable(X) from the dataset. For x-variable, we have taken parameters as :,1:2, because we want 1 index(levels), and included :2 to make it as a matrix. Output: By executing the above code, we can read our dataset as: As we can see in the above output, there are three columns present (Positions, Levels, and Salaries). But we are only considering two columns because Positions are equivalent to the levels or may be seen as the encoded form of Positions. Here we will predict the output for level6.5because the candidate has 4+ years' experience as a regional manager, so he must be somewhere between levels 7 and 6. Building the Linear regression model: Now, we will build and fit the Linear regression model to the dataset. In building polynomial regression, we will take the Linear regression model as reference and compare both the results. The code is given below: In the above code, we have created the Simple Linear model usinglin_regsobject ofLinearRegressionclass and fitted it to the dataset variables (x and y). Output: Building the Polynomial regression model: Now we will build the Polynomial Regression model, but it will be a little different from the Simple Linear model. Because here we will usePolynomialFeaturesclass ofpreprocessinglibrary. We are using this class to add some extra features to our dataset. In the above lines of code, we have usedpoly_regs.fit_transform(x), because first we are converting our feature matrix into polynomial feature matrix, and then fitting it to the Polynomial regression model. The parameter value(degree= 2) depends on our choice. We can choose it according to our Polynomial features. After executing the code, we will get another matrixx_poly, which can be seen under the variable explorer option: Next, we have used another LinearRegression object, namelylin_reg_2, to fit ourx_polyvector to the linear model. Output: Visualizing the result for Linear regression: Now we will visualize the result for Linear regression model as we did in Simple Linear Regression. Below is the code for it: Output: In the above output image, we can clearly see that the regression line is so far from the datasets. Predictions are in a red straight line, and blue points are actual values. If we consider this output to predict the value of CEO, it will give a salary of approx. 600000$, which is far away from the real value. So we need a curved model to fit the dataset other than a straight line. Visualizing the result for Polynomial Regression Here we will visualize the result of Polynomial regression model, code for which is little different from the above model. Code for this is given below: In the above code, we have taken lin_reg_2.predict(poly_regs.fit_transform(x), instead of x_poly, because we want a Linear regressor object to predict the polynomial features matrix. Output: As we can see in the above output image, the predictions are close to the real values. The above plot will vary as we will change the degree. For degree= 3: If we change the degree=3, then we will give a more accurate plot, as shown in the below image. SO as we can see here in the above output image, the predicted salary for level 6.5 is near to 170K$-190k$, which seems that future employee is saying the truth about his salary. Degree= 4:Let's again change the degree to 4, and now will get the most accurate plot. Hence we can get more accurate results by increasing the degree of Polynomial. Predicting the final result with the Linear Regression model: Now, we will predict the final output using the Linear regression model to see whether an employee is saying truth or bluff. So, for this, we will use thepredict()method and will pass the value 6.5. Below is the code for it: Output: Predicting the final result with the Polynomial Regression model: Now, we will predict the final output using the Polynomial Regression model to compare with Linear model. Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see, the predicted output for the Polynomial Regression is 158862.45265153, which is much closer to real value hence, we can say that future employee is saying true."," for machine learning training:

**Polynomial Regression**

Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

**Steps**

1. **Data Pre-processing**: The data pre-processing step remains the same as in previous regression models, except for the following changes:
	* No feature scaling is used.
	* The dataset is not split into training and test sets.
2. **Building the Linear Regression Model**: A Simple Linear Regression model is built and fitted to the dataset using the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn.linear_model` library.
3. **Building the Polynomial Regression Model**: A Polynomial Regression model is built using the `PolynomialFeatures` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` library. The degree of the polynomial is set to 2.
4. **Visualizing the Results**: The results of both the Linear Regression model and the Polynomial Regression model are visualized using scatter plots.
5. **Predicting the Output**: The final output is predicted using both the Linear Regression model and the Polynomial Regression model.

**Code**

The code for the data pre-processing step is as follows:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Position_Salaries.csv')

# Extract the dependent and independent variables
X = df[['Levels']]
y = df['Salary']

# Create a PolynomialFeatures object with degree 2
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)

# Fit the polynomial features to the data
X_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X)

# Create a LinearRegression object
lin_reg = LinearRegression()

# Fit the Linear Regression model to the data
lin_reg.fit(X, y)
```
The code for building the Polynomial Regression model is as follows:
```python
# Create a PolynomialRegression object with degree 2
poly_reg = PolynomialRegression(degree=2)

# Fit the Polynomial Regression model to the data
poly_reg.fit(X_poly, y)
```
The code for visualizing the results is as follows:
```python
# Visualize the results of the Linear Regression model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, lin_reg.predict(X), color='red')

**Classification Algorithm**

The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique used to categorize new observations based on training data. It learns from a given dataset or observations and classifies new observations into predefined categories or groups. Examples of categories include:

* Yes or No
* 0 or 1
* Spam or Not Spam
* Cat or Dog

In Classification, the output variable is a category, not a value. For instance:

* ""Green or Blue""
* ""Fruit or Animal""

Since Classification is a Supervised Learning technique, it requires labeled input data, which contains input data with corresponding output labels. The algorithm maps a discrete output function (y) to an input variable (x).

1. **Binary Classifier**: A Binary Classifier is used when a classification problem has only two possible outcomes. Examples include:
	* YES or NO
	* MALE or FEMALE
	* SPAM or NOT SPAM
	* CAT or DOG
2. **Multi-class Classifier**: A Multi-class Classifier is used when a classification problem has more than two outcomes. Examples include:

**Logistic Regression**

Logistic regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of supervised learning techniques. Its primary objective is to predict a categorical dependent variable based on a given set of independent variables.

**Predicting Categorical Variables**

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable, which must be a discrete value. This can be represented as a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No, True or False), or a multi-class classification problem. Unlike linear regression, which provides exact values, logistic regression outputs probabilistic values between 0 and 1.

**Key Differences from Linear Regression**

Logistic regression is similar to linear regression in that it is a regression-based algorithm. However, the primary difference lies in their application. Linear regression is used for solving regression problems, whereas logistic regression is used for solving classification problems. In logistic regression, instead of fitting a linear regression line, we fit an ""S""-shaped logistic function that predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).

**Logistic Function**

The logistic function is a sigmoid curve that indicates the likelihood of an event occurring. For example, it can be used to predict the likelihood of a cell being cancerous or a mouse being obese based on its weight. The curve provides a probability value between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the event.

Predicting the Test Result Our model is well trained on the training set, so we will now predict the result by using test set data. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have created a y_pred vector to predict the test set result. Output:By executing the above code, a new vector (y_pred) will be created under the variable explorer option. It can be seen as: The above output image shows the corresponding predicted users who want to purchase or not purchase the car. 4. Test Accuracy of the result Now we will create the confusion matrix here to check the accuracy of the classification. To create it, we need to import theconfusion_matrixfunction of the sklearn library. After importing the function, we will call it using a new variablecm. The function takes two parameters, mainlyy_true( the actual values) andy_pred(the targeted value return by the classifier). Below is the code for it: Output: By executing the above code, a new confusion matrix will be created. Consider the below image: We can find the accuracy of the predicted result by interpreting the confusion matrix. By above output, we can interpret that 65+24= 89 (Correct Output) and 8+3= 11(Incorrect Output). 5. Visualizing the training set result Finally, we will visualize the training set result. To visualize the result, we will useListedColormapclass of matplotlib library. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have imported theListedColormapclass of Matplotlib library to create the colormap for visualizing the result. We have created two new variablesx_setandy_setto replacex_trainandy_train. After that, we have used thenm.meshgridcommand to create a rectangular grid, which has a range of -1(minimum) to 1 (maximum). The pixel points we have taken are of 0.01 resolution. To create a filled contour, we have usedmtp.contourfcommand, it will create regions of provided colors (purple and green). In this function, we have passed theclassifier.predictto show the predicted data points predicted by the classifier. Output:By executing the above code, we will get the below output: The graph can be explained in the below points: In the above graph, we can see that there are someGreen pointswithin the green region andPurple pointswithin the purple region.All these data points are the observation points from the training set, which shows the result for purchased variables.This graph is made by using two independent variables i.e.,Age on the x-axisandEstimated salary on the y-axis.Thepurple point observationsare for which purchased (dependent variable) is probably 0, i.e., users who did not purchase the SUV car.Thegreen point observationsare for which purchased (dependent variable) is probably 1 means user who purchased the SUV car.We can also estimate from the graph that the users who are younger with low salary, did not purchase the car, whereas older users with high estimated salary purchased the car.But there are some purple points in the green region (Buying the car) and some green points in the purple region(Not buying the car). So we can say that younger users with a high estimated salary purchased the car, whereas an older user with a low estimated salary did not purchase the car. The goal of the classifier: We have successfully visualized the training set result for the logistic regression, and our goal for this classification is to divide the users who purchased the SUV car and who did not purchase the car. So from the output graph, we can clearly see the two regions (Purple and Green) with the observation points. The Purple region is for those users who didn't buy the car, and Green Region is for those users who purchased the car. Linear Classifier: As we can see from the graph, the classifier is a Straight line or linear in nature as we have used the Linear model for Logistic Regression. In further topics, we will learn for non-linear Classifiers. Visualizing the test set result: Our model is well trained using the training dataset. Now, we will visualize the result for new observations (Test set). The code for the test set will remain same as above except that here we will usex_test and y_testinstead ofx_train and y_train. Below is the code for it: Output: The above graph shows the test set result. As we can see, the graph is divided into two regions (Purple and Green). And Green observations are in the green region, and Purple observations are in the purple region. So we can say it is a good prediction and model. Some of the green and purple data points are in different regions, which can be ignored as we have already calculated this error using the confusion matrix (11 Incorrect output). Hence our model is pretty good and ready to make new predictions for this classification problem.","ession in Python**

To understand the implementation of Logistic Regression in Python, we will use a real-world example. A car manufacturing company wants to predict how many users from a social media dataset will purchase their new SUV car. We will build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains information about various users, including their age and salary. Our goal is to predict the ""purchased"" variable (dependent variable) using age and salary (independent variables).

**Steps in Logistic Regression**

1. **Data Pre-processing**: We will pre-process the data to prepare it for use in our code. This step is similar to the data pre-processing topic.
2. **Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training Set**: We will train the dataset using the training set. We will import the `LogisticRegression` class from the `sklearn` library and create a classifier object to fit the model to the logistic regression.
3. **Predicting the Test Result**: We will use the trained model to predict the test set result.
4. **Test Accuracy of the Result**: We will create a confusion matrix to check the accuracy of the classification.
5. **Visualizing the Training Set Result**: We will visualize the training set result using a colormap from the `matplotlib` library.

**Code**

Here is the code for each step:

1. Data Pre-processing:
```
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale the independent variables
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(x)

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

2. Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training Set:
```
# Import the LogisticRegression class
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Create a classifier object
clf = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to the training set
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

3. Predicting the Test Result:
```
# Predict the test set result
y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)
```

4. Test Accuracy of the Result:
```
# Create a confusion matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
```

5. Visualizing the Training Set Result:

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a fundamental machine learning technique based on supervised learning. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning. KNN assumes that the similarity between a new data point and available data points is the key to classifying the new data point into a specific category. The algorithm stores all available data and classifies new data points based on their similarity to the existing data.

**Key Characteristics**

1. **Non-parametric**: KNN does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
2. **Lazy Learner**: KNN does not learn from the training set immediately. Instead, it stores the dataset and performs an action on the dataset at the time of classification.
3. **Classification and Regression**: KNN can be used for both classification and regression problems, but it is more commonly used for classification tasks.

**How KNN Works**

During the training phase, KNN stores the dataset. When a new data point is presented, the algorithm calculates the similarity between the new data point and the available data points. The new data point is then classified into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

**Example**

Suppose we have an image of a creature that resembles a cat and a dog. We want to identify whether it is a cat or a dog. KNN can be used to classify the image based on its similarity to cat and dog images. The KNN model will find the similar features of the new data set to the cat and dog images and classify it into either the cat or dog category based on the most similar features.

6. **Step 6: Model ready**: The K-NN model is now ready for classification.

Suppose we have a new data point and need to classify it. Let's consider an example:

**Step 1: Choose the number of neighbors (K)**: We choose K = 5.

**Step 2: Calculate Euclidean distance**: Calculate the Euclidean distance between the new data point and the K nearest neighbors.

**Step 3: Identify the K nearest neighbors**: We obtain the nearest neighbors, with three neighbors in category A and two neighbors in category B.

**Step 4: Count the number of neighbors in each category**: We count the number of neighbors in each category: 3 neighbors in category A and 2 neighbors in category B.

**Step 5: Assign the new data point to a category**: Since the majority of the neighbors (3 out of 5) belong to category A, we assign the new data point to category A.

**Result**: The new data point is classified as belonging to category A.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm**

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. However, it is primarily employed for classification tasks in machine learning. The primary objective of the SVM algorithm is to create an optimal decision boundary, also known as a hyperplane, that can effectively segregate n-dimensional space into distinct classes. This allows for accurate classification of new data points in the future.

The SVM algorithm selects the most extreme points or vectors that aid in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are referred to as support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine. The algorithm's performance is heavily reliant on these support vectors.

**Illustrative Example**

To better understand the SVM algorithm, consider the following example. Suppose we want to develop a model that can accurately identify whether a given image is a cat or a dog. The SVM algorithm can be used to achieve this. We can train the model with a large dataset of cat and dog images, allowing it to learn the distinct features of each species. Then, we can test the model with a strange image that exhibits characteristics of both cats and dogs. The SVM algorithm will create a decision boundary between the cat and dog data and select the most extreme cases (support vectors). Based on these support vectors, the algorithm will classify the image as a cat.

In n-dimensional space, multiple decision boundaries can be used to separate classes. However, the goal is to find the optimal decision boundary that effectively classifies data points. This optimal boundary is known as the hyperplane in Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dimensions of the hyperplane depend on the features present in the dataset. For instance, if there are two features, the hyperplane will be a straight line. If there are three features, the hyperplane will be a 2-dimensional plane.

**Maximum Margin Hyperplane**

To create an effective hyperplane, we always aim to create one with a maximum margin, which is the maximum distance between data points. This ensures that the hyperplane is as far away as possible from the data points, resulting in a robust classification model.

**Support Vectors**

Data points or vectors that are closest to the hyperplane and affect its position are referred to as Support Vectors. Since these vectors support the hyperplane, they are called Support Vectors. These vectors play a crucial role in determining the position and orientation of the hyperplane, making them essential for the classification process.

Suppose we have a dataset that has two tags (green and blue), and the dataset has two features x1 and x2. We want a classifier that can classify the pair(x1, x2) of coordinates in either green or blue. Consider the below image: So as it is 2-d space so by just using a straight line, we can easily separate these two classes. But there can be multiple lines that can separate these classes. Consider the below image: Hence, the SVM algorithm helps to find the best line or decision boundary; this best boundary or region is called as ahyperplane. SVM algorithm finds the closest point of the lines from both the classes. These points are called support vectors. The distance between the vectors and the hyperplane is called asmargin. And the goal of SVM is to maximize this margin. Thehyperplanewith maximum margin is called theoptimal hyperplane. Non-Linear SVM: If data is linearly arranged, then we can separate it by using a straight line, but for non-linear data, we cannot draw a single straight line. Consider the below image: So to separate these data points, we need to add one more dimension. For linear data, we have used two dimensions x and y, so for non-linear data, we will add a third dimension z. It can be calculated as: By adding the third dimension, the sample space will become as below image: So now, SVM will divide the datasets into classes in the following way. Consider the below image: Since we are in 3-d Space, hence it is looking like a plane parallel to the x-axis. If we convert it in 2d space with z=1, then it will become as: Hence we get a circumference of radius 1 in case of non-linear data. Python Implementation of Support Vector Machine Now we will implement the SVM algorithm using Python. Here we will use the same datasetuser_data, which we have used in Logistic regression and KNN classification. Data Pre-processing step Till the Data pre-processing step, the code will remain the same. Below is the code: After executing the above code, we will pre-process the data. The code will give the dataset as: The scaled output for the test set will be: Fitting the SVM classifier to the training set: Now the training set will be fitted to the SVM classifier. To create the SVM classifier, we will importSVCclass fromSklearn.svmlibrary. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have usedkernel='linear', as here we are creating SVM for linearly separable data. However, we can change it for non-linear data. And then we fitted the classifier to the training dataset(x_train, y_train) Output: The model performance can be altered by changing the value ofC(Regularization factor), gamma, and kernel. Predicting the test set result:Now, we will predict the output for test set. For this, we will create a new vector y_pred. Below is the code for it: After getting the y_pred vector, we can compare the result ofy_predandy_testto check the difference between the actual value and predicted value. Output:Below is the output for the prediction of the test set: Creating the confusion matrix:Now we will see the performance of the SVM classifier that how many incorrect predictions are there as compared to the Logistic regression classifier. To create the confusion matrix, we need to import theconfusion_matrixfunction of the sklearn library. After importing the function, we will call it using a new variablecm. The function takes two parameters, mainlyy_true( the actual values) andy_pred(the targeted value return by the classifier). Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see in the above output image, there are 66+24= 90 correct predictions and 8+2= 10 correct predictions.

Visualizing the test set result: Output: By executing the above code, we will get the output as: As we can see in the above output image, the SVM classifier has divided the users into two regions (Purchased or Not purchased). Users who purchased the SUV are in the red region with the red scatter points. And users who did not purchase the SUV are in the green region with green scatter points. The hyperplane has divided the two classes into Purchased and not purchased variable."," for machine learning training:

**Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm can be understood by considering a simple example. Suppose we have a dataset with two tags (green and blue) and two features (x1 and x2). We want to classify pairs of coordinates (x1, x2) into either green or blue. In a 2D space, a straight line can easily separate these two classes. However, there may be multiple lines that can separate these classes.

The SVM algorithm helps find the best line or decision boundary, which is called a hyperplane. The algorithm finds the closest points to the lines from both classes, known as support vectors. The distance between the vectors and the hyperplane is called the margin. The goal of SVM is to maximize this margin. The hyperplane with the maximum margin is called the optimal hyperplane.

**Non-Linear SVM**

If the data is not linearly separable, we cannot separate it using a single straight line. To separate non-linear data, we need to add another dimension. For linear data, we use two dimensions (x and y), so for non-linear data, we add a third dimension (z). This can be calculated as:

By adding the third dimension, the sample space becomes:

In this 3D space, SVM divides the datasets into classes in the following way:

Since we are in 3D space, the resulting hyperplane appears as a plane parallel to the x-axis. If we convert it to 2D space with z=1, it becomes:

In this case, we get a circumference of radius 1 for non-linear data.

**Python Implementation of Support Vector Machine**

We will implement the SVM algorithm using Python. We will use the same dataset (user_data) used in Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification.

**Data Pre-processing**

The code for data pre-processing remains the same as in Logistic Regression and KNN classification.

**Fitting the SVM Classifier**

We will import the `SVC` class from `sklearn.svm` library and create an SVM classifier. We will use a linear kernel for linearly separable data.

**Predicting the Test Set Result**

We will predict the output for the test set using the `predict` method. We will create a new vector `y_pred` to store the predicted values.

**Naive Bayes Classifier Example: Weather Conditions and Playing**

The Naive Bayes classifier can be understood through an example. Suppose we have a dataset of weather conditions and a target variable ""Play"". We want to decide whether to play or not on a particular day based on the weather conditions. To solve this problem, we follow these steps:

1. Convert the dataset into frequency tables.
2. Generate a likelihood table by finding the probabilities of the given features.
3. Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

**Problem:** If the weather is sunny, should the player play or not?

**Solution:** To solve this, we consider the following dataset:

**Frequency Table for Weather Conditions:**

| Weather Condition | Yes | No |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sunny | 3 | 2 |
| Rainy | 2 | 3 |
| Cloudy | 1 | 4 |

**Likelihood Table:**

| Weather Condition | P(Yes|Weather) | P(No|Weather) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sunny | 3/10 = 0.3 | 2/4 = 0.5 |
| Rainy | 2/5 = 0.4 | 3/5 = 0.6 |
| Cloudy | 1/5 = 0.2 | 4/5 = 0.8 |

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Yes|Sunny) = P(Sunny|Yes) \* P(Yes) / P(Sunny)
= 0.3 \* 0.71 / 0.35
= 0.60

P(No|Sunny) = P(Sunny|No) \* P(No) / P(Sunny)
= 0.5 \* 0.29 / 0.35
= 0.41

**Conclusion:** As we can see from the calculation, P(Yes|Sunny) > P(No|Sunny). Therefore, on a sunny day, the player can play the game.

201,regression-vs-classification-in-machine-learning,https://www.javatpoint.com/regression-vs-classification-in-machine-learning,"Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y). Example:The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. The model is trained on the basis of millions of emails on different parameters, and whenever it receives a new email, it identifies whether the email is spam or not. If the email is spam, then it is moved to the Spam folder. Types of ML Classification Algorithms: Classification Algorithms can be further divided into the following types: Logistic RegressionK-Nearest NeighboursSupport Vector MachinesKernel SVMNave BayesDecision Tree ClassificationRandom Forest Classification","n**

Classification is a fundamental concept in machine learning that involves identifying a function to categorize data into predefined classes based on various parameters. In a classification problem, a computer program is trained on a dataset and uses this training to categorize new, unseen data into distinct classes. The primary goal of a classification algorithm is to establish a mapping function that maps input data (x) to a discrete output (y).

**Example: Email Spam Detection**

A classic example of classification is email spam detection. In this scenario, a model is trained on millions of emails, considering various parameters. When a new email arrives, the model identifies whether it is spam or not. If the email is deemed spam, it is moved to a designated spam folder.

**Types of Classification Algorithms**

Classification algorithms can be categorized into the following types:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A popular algorithm that uses a logistic function to predict the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbours.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm that uses a kernel function to transform data into a higher-dimensional space, making it easier to classify.
4. **Kernel SVM**: A variant of SVM that uses a kernel function to transform data.
5. **Naive Bayes**: A family of probabilistic algorithms that use Bayes' theorem to classify data.
6. **Decision Tree Classification**: A tree-based algorithm that uses a decision tree to classify data.

If our dataset contains some missing data, then it may create a huge problem for our machine learning model. Hence it is necessary to handle missing values present in the dataset. Ways to handle missing data: There are mainly two ways to handle missing data, which are: By deleting the particular row:The first way is used to commonly deal with null values. In this way, we just delete the specific row or column which consists of null values. But this way is not so efficient and removing data may lead to loss of information which will not give the accurate output. By calculating the mean:In this way, we will calculate the mean of that column or row which contains any missing value and will put it on the place of missing value.

To handle missing values, we will useScikit-learnlibrary in our code, which contains various libraries for building machine learning models. Here we will useImputerclass ofsklearn.preprocessinglibrary. Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see in the above output, the missing values have been replaced with the means of rest column values.","

**Handling Missing Data in Datasets**

In the next step of data preprocessing, it is crucial to handle missing data in the datasets. Missing data can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models, making it essential to address these values. There are two primary methods to handle missing data:

1. **Deleting the Row/Column**: This approach involves deleting the entire row or column containing missing values. While this method is simple, it can lead to data loss and may not provide accurate results.
2. **Calculating the Mean**: In this approach, the mean of the column or row containing missing values is calculated and used to replace the missing values. This strategy is effective for features with numeric data, such as age, salary, and year.

In this example, we will use the latter approach to handle missing values. To do so, we will utilize the `Imputer` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` library in our code. This library is part of the Scikit-learn library, which provides various tools for building machine learning models.

**Code Example**

Here is the code snippet that demonstrates how to handle missing values using the `Imputer` class:
```
# Import the necessary library
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer

# Create an instance of the Imputer class
imputer = Imputer(strategy='mean')

# Fit the imputer to the data and replace missing values
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```
**Output**

The output of the code shows that the missing values have been replaced with the mean of the rest of the column values.

By using the `Imputer` class, we can effectively handle missing data in our dataset and ensure that our machine learning model receives accurate and complete information."

Therefore, it is essential to encode these categorical variables into numerical values.

**Label Encoding**

To encode the Country variable, we use the LabelEncoder class from the sklearn library. The output shows that the variables have been successfully encoded into digits. However, in our case, there are three country variables, and the output indicates that they have been encoded into 0, 1, and 2. This may lead the machine learning model to assume correlations between these variables, resulting in incorrect outputs. To address this issue, we will use dummy encoding.

The model's ability to accurately predict the output on unseen data is a key indicator of its effectiveness.

To illustrate the concept of supervised learning, consider the following example:

Suppose we have a dataset containing images of different shapes, including squares, rectangles, triangles, and polygons. The first step is to train a model to recognize each shape. To do this, we label each image with its corresponding shape type. For instance, if an image has four sides of equal length, it is labeled as a square. If an image has three sides, it is labeled as a triangle. If an image has six equal sides, it is labeled as a hexagon.

After training, we test our model using a test dataset, and its task is to identify the shape in each image. Since the model has been trained on all types of shapes, when it encounters a new image, it can classify the shape based on the number of sides and predict the output. This process enables the model to make accurate predictions on unseen data, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that trains models using unlabeled datasets, allowing them to act on the data without supervision. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have corresponding output data for the input data. The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to:

The algorithm is not trained on the dataset, meaning it has no prior knowledge of the dataset's features. The task is to identify image features independently. The unsupervised learning algorithm achieves this by clustering the image dataset into groups based on similarities between images.

* Models are not supervised using a training dataset
* Trains on unlabeled datasets
* Does not have corresponding output data for input data

**Machine Learning Techniques: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. There are two primary techniques of machine learning: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. While both techniques are used to analyze and learn from data, they differ in their approach, application, and dataset requirements.

**Supervised Learning**

Supervised Learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the target output is already known. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the labeled data, enabling it to make predictions on new, unseen data. Supervised Learning is commonly used in applications such as image classification, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.

**Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised Learning, on the other hand, involves training a model on unlabeled data. The model discovers patterns, relationships, and structures in the data without prior knowledge of the target output. Unsupervised Learning is commonly used in applications such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

**Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**

It predicts continuous/real values such astemperature, age, salary, price,etc. We can understand the concept of regression analysis using the below example: Example:Suppose there is a marketing company A, who does various advertisement every year and get sales on that. The below list shows the advertisement made by the company in the last 5 years and the corresponding sales: Now, the company wants to do the advertisement of $200 in the year 2019and wants to know the prediction about the sales for this year.

**Regression Analysis**

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent (target) variable and one or more independent (predictor) variables. It helps to understand how the value of the dependent variable changes in response to an independent variable, while holding other independent variables constant. Regression analysis predicts continuous or real values, such as temperature, age, salary, or price.

**Example**

Suppose a marketing company, A, conducts various advertisements each year and tracks the corresponding sales. The company wants to predict the sales for a year in which they plan to spend $200 on advertisements. To solve this type of prediction problem in machine learning, we use regression analysis.

**Regression as a Supervised Learning Technique**

Regression is a supervised learning technique that finds the correlation between variables and enables the prediction of a continuous output variable based on one or more predictor variables. It is commonly used for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.

**Regression Graph**

In regression, we plot a graph between the variables that best fits the given data points. This graph enables the machine learning model to make predictions about the data. In simple terms, regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the data points on the target-predictor graph, such that the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line is minimized.

**Distance between Datapoints and Line**

The distance between the data points and the line indicates whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not. A smaller distance indicates a strong relationship, while a larger distance indicates a weaker relationship.

* Predicting rain using temperature and other factors

The dependent variable, also referred to as the target variable, is the primary factor in regression analysis that we aim to predict or understand. It is the variable whose values we are trying to explain or forecast.

**Independent Variable**

The independent variables, also known as predictors, are the factors that affect the dependent variable or are used to predict its values. These variables are the inputs or features that are used to train the regression model.

**Outliers**

An outlier is an observation that contains a value that is significantly lower or higher compared to the other observed values. Outliers can significantly impact the results of the analysis and should be avoided or handled properly to ensure accurate predictions.

**Multicollinearity**

Multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to determine the relative importance of each variable. This condition should be avoided in the dataset, as it can lead to problems in ranking the most influential variables.

**Underfitting and Overfitting**

Underfitting occurs when a model is unable to accurately predict the values of the dependent variable, even when trained on the training dataset. On the other hand, overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training dataset but fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. Both underfitting and overfitting can be addressed through techniques such as regularization, feature selection, and model ensemble.

Y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + ... + bnxn

where:

* Y is the predicted or target output
* b0, b1, ..., bn are the regression coefficients
* x is the independent or input variable

The model is still linear, as the coefficients are still linear with quadratic terms.

**Key Takeaways**

* Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis that models non-linear datasets using a linear model.
* It is necessary when the dataset consists of non-linear datapoints.
* The equation for polynomial regression is derived from the linear regression equation and involves polynomial terms.
* The model is still linear, with quadratic terms."

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be applied to both regression and classification problems. When used for regression problems, it is referred to as Support Vector Regression. SVR is a regression algorithm that works with continuous variables.

**Key Concepts**

* **Kernel**: A function that maps lower-dimensional data to higher-dimensional data.
* **Hyperplane**: A line that separates classes in general SVM, but in SVR, it is a line that predicts continuous variables and covers most data points.
* **Boundary Line**: The two lines that create a margin for data points, apart from the hyperplane.
* **Support Vectors**: Data points that are nearest to the hyperplane and opposite class.

**Goal of SVR**

The primary objective of SVR is to consider the maximum number of data points within the boundary lines and the hyperplane (best-fit line). This ensures that the hyperplane contains a maximum number of data points.

**Illustration**

Linear relationship between the features and target:Linear regression assumes the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.Small or no multicollinearity between the features:Multicollinearity means high-correlation between the independent variables. Due to multicollinearity, it may difficult to find the true relationship between the predictors and target variables. Or we can say, it is difficult to determine which predictor variable is affecting the target variable and which is not. So, the model assumes either little or no multicollinearity between the features or independent variables.Homoscedasticity Assumption:Homoscedasticity is a situation when the error term is the same for all the values of independent variables. With homoscedasticity, there should be no clear pattern distribution of data in the scatter plot.Normal distribution of error terms:Linear regression assumes that the error term should follow the normal distribution pattern. If error terms are not normally distributed, then confidence intervals will become either too wide or too narrow, which may cause difficulties in finding coefficients.It can be checked using theq-q plot. If the plot shows a straight line without any deviation, which means the error is normally distributed.No autocorrelations:The linear regression model assumes no autocorrelation in error terms. If there will be any correlation in the error term, then it will drastically reduce the accuracy of the model. Autocorrelation usually occurs if there is a dependency between residual errors.","f Linear Regression**

Linear regression is a widely used statistical model that relies on several key assumptions to produce accurate results. These assumptions are crucial to ensure that the model is reliable and effective in predicting the target variable. The following are the essential assumptions of linear regression:

1. **Linear Relationship between Features and Target**: Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target). This means that the relationship between the variables is a straight line.

2. **No or Low Multicollinearity**: Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high correlation between the independent variables. This can make it challenging to determine the true relationship between the predictors and the target variable. Therefore, linear regression assumes either no or low multicollinearity between the features.

3. **Homoscedasticity**: Homoscedasticity is a situation where the error term is constant across all values of the independent variables. This means that there should be no clear pattern in the distribution of data in the scatter plot.

4. **Normal Distribution of Error Terms**: Linear regression assumes that the error terms should follow a normal distribution pattern. If the error terms are not normally distributed, confidence intervals may become too wide or too narrow, making it difficult to find accurate coefficients. The normality of error terms can be checked using a q-q plot. If the plot shows a straight line without any deviation, it indicates that the error is normally distributed.

5. **No Autocorrelation**: Linear regression assumes no autocorrelation in the error terms. Autocorrelation occurs when there is a dependency between residual errors. If there is autocorrelation, it can significantly reduce the accuracy of the model.

By ensuring that these assumptions are met, linear regression can produce accurate and reliable results, enabling effective prediction and analysis of the target variable."

In this section, we will create a Simple Linear Regression model to find out the best fitting line for representing the relationship between these two variables. To implement the Simple Linear regression model in machine learning using Python, we need to follow the below steps: Step-1: Data Pre-processing The first step for creating the Simple Linear Regression model isdata pre-processing. We have already done it earlier in this tutorial. But there will be some changes, which are given in the below steps: First, we will import the three important libraries, which will help us for loading the dataset, plotting the graphs, and creating the Simple Linear Regression model. Next, we will load the dataset into our code: By executing the above line of code (ctrl+ENTER), we can read the dataset on our Spyder IDE screen by clicking on the variable explorer option. The above output shows the dataset, which has two variables: Salary and Experience. After that, we need to extract the dependent and independent variables from the given dataset. The independent variable is years of experience, and the dependent variable is salary. Below is code for it: In the above lines of code, for x variable, we have taken -1 value since we want to remove the last column from the dataset. For y variable, we have taken 1 value as a parameter, since we want to extract the second column and indexing starts from the zero. By executing the above line of code, we will get the output for X and Y variable as: In the above output image, we can see the X (independent) variable and Y (dependent) variable has been extracted from the given dataset. Next, we will split both variables into the test set and training set. We have 30 observations, so we will take 20 observations for the training set and 10 observations for the test set. We are splitting our dataset so that we can train our model using a training dataset and then test the model using a test dataset. The code for this is given below: By executing the above code, we will get x-test, x-train and y-test, y-train dataset. Consider the below images: Test-dataset: Training Dataset: For simple linear Regression, we will not use Feature Scaling. Because Python libraries take care of it for some cases, so we don't need to perform it here.

Step-2: Fitting the Simple Linear Regression to the Training Set: Now the second step is to fit our model to the training dataset. To do so, we will import theLinearRegressionclass of thelinear_modellibrary from thescikit learn. After importing the class, we are going to create an object of the class named as aregressor. The code for this is given below: In the above code, we have used afit()method to fit our Simple Linear Regression object to the training set. In the fit() function, we have passed the x_train and y_train, which is our training dataset for the dependent and an independent variable. We have fitted our regressor object to the training set so that the model can easily learn the correlations between the predictor and target variables. After executing the above lines of code, we will get the below output. Output: Step: 3. Prediction of test set result: dependent (salary) and an independent variable (Experience). So, now, our model is ready to predict the output for the new observations. In this step, we will provide the test dataset (new observations) to the model to check whether it can predict the correct output or not. We will create a prediction vectory_pred, andx_pred, which will contain predictions of test dataset, and prediction of training set respectively. On executing the above lines of code, two variables named y_pred and x_pred will generate in the variable explorer options that contain salary predictions for the training set and test set. Output: You can check the variable by clicking on the variable explorer option in the IDE, and also compare the result by comparing values from y_pred and y_test. By comparing these values, we can check how good our model is performing. Step: 4. visualizing the Training set results: Now in this step, we will visualize the training set result. To do so, we will use the scatter() function of the pyplot library, which we have already imported in the pre-processing step. Thescatter () functionwill create a scatter plot of observations. In the x-axis, we will plot the Years of Experience of employees and on the y-axis, salary of employees. In the function, we will pass the real values of training set, which means a year of experience x_train, training set of Salaries y_train, and color of the observations. Here we are taking a green color for the observation, but it can be any color as per the choice. Now, we need to plot the regression line, so for this, we will use theplot() functionof the pyplot library. In this function, we will pass the years of experience for training set, predicted salary for training set x_pred, and color of the line. Next, we will give the title for the plot. So here, we will use thetitle()function of thepyplotlibrary and pass the name (""Salary vs Experience (Training Dataset)"". After that, we will assign labels for x-axis and y-axis usingxlabel() and ylabel() function. Finally, we will represent all above things in a graph using show(). The code is given below: Output: By executing the above lines of code, we will get the below graph plot as an output. In the above plot, we can see the real values observations in green dots and predicted values are covered by the red regression line. The regression line shows a correlation between the dependent and independent variable. The good fit of the line can be observed by calculating the difference between actual values and predicted values. But as we can see in the aboveplot, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence our model is good for the training set. Step: 5. visualizing the Test set results: In the previous step, we have visualized the performance of our model on the training set. Now, we will do the same for the Test set. The complete code will remain the same as the above code, except in this, we will use x_test, and y_test instead of x_train and y_train. Here we are also changing the color of observations and regression line to differentiate between the two plots, but it is optional. Output: By executing the above line of code, we will get the output as: In the above plot, there are observations given by the blue color, and prediction is given by the red regression line. As we can see, most of the observations are close to the regression line, hence we can say our Simple Linear Regression is a good model and able to make good predictions.","ment for Simple Linear Regression**

The goal of this problem is to analyze the relationship between two variables: salary (dependent variable) and experience (independent variable). We will create a Simple Linear Regression model to find the best-fitting line that represents the relationship between these two variables.

**Step 1: Data Pre-processing**

We will import the necessary libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for plotting, and `sklearn` for machine learning. We will load the dataset and extract the dependent and independent variables. The independent variable is years of experience, and the dependent variable is salary.

**Step 2: Fitting the Simple Linear Regression to the Training Set**

We will import the `LinearRegression` class from `sklearn.linear_model` and create an object named `regressor`. We will fit the model to the training set using the `fit()` method, passing the `x_train` and `y_train` variables as arguments.

**Step 3: Prediction of Test Set Results**

We will use the trained model to predict the output for the test set. We will create a prediction vector `y_pred` and `x_pred` containing the predictions for the test and training sets, respectively.

**Step 4: Visualizing the Training Set Results**

We will use the `scatter()` function to create a scatter plot of the training set observations. We will plot the years of experience on the x-axis and salary on the y-axis. We will also plot the regression line using the `plot()` function and add a title, labels, and show the plot.

**Step 5: Visualizing the Test Set Results**

We will repeat the same steps as Step 4, but using the test set data instead. We will use `x_test` and `y_test` instead of `x_train` and `y_train`, and change the color of the observations and regression line to differentiate between the two plots.

The output of the code will be two plots: one for the training set and one for the test set. The plots will show the real values of the observations in green dots and the predicted values covered by the red regression line. The regression line shows a correlation between the dependent and independent variable, and the good fit of the line can be observed by calculating the difference between actual values and predicted values."

Moreover, Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear regression as it takes more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable. We can define it as: Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable. Example: Prediction of CO2emission based on engine size and number of cylinders in a car. Some key points about MLR: For MLR, the dependent or target variable(Y) must be the continuous/real, but the predictor or independent variable may be of continuous or categorical form.Each feature variable must model the linear relationship with the dependent variable.MLR tries to fit a regression line through a multidimensional space of data-points.","ar Regression**

In the previous topic, we explored Simple Linear Regression, where a single independent/predictor variable is used to model the response variable (Y). However, there are scenarios where the response variable is influenced by multiple predictor variables. This is where Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) comes into play. As an extension of Simple Linear Regression, MLR uses more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable.

**Definition**

Multiple Linear Regression is a significant regression algorithm that models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and multiple independent variables.

**Example**

For instance, predicting CO2 emissions based on engine size and number of cylinders in a car is a classic example of MLR.

**Key Points**

For MLR:

* The dependent or target variable (Y) must be continuous/real-valued.
* The predictor or independent variable can be either continuous or categorical.
* Each feature variable must model a linear relationship with the dependent variable.
* MLR attempts to fit a regression line through a multidimensional space of data points.

So we need to encode this variable. Encoding Dummy Variables: As we have one categorical variable (State), which cannot be directly applied to the model, so we will encode it. To encode the categorical variable into numbers, we will use theLabelEncoderclass. But it is not sufficient because it still has some relational order, which may create a wrong model.

To implement Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using Python, we have a problem statement:

**Problem Description**

We have a dataset of 50 start-up companies with five main variables: R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, State, and Profit for a financial year. Our goal is to create a model that can easily determine which company has the maximum profit and which factor has the most significant impact on a company's profit. Since we need to predict the Profit, it is the dependent variable, and the other four variables are independent variables.

**Main Steps**

To deploy the MLR model, we will follow these main steps:

1. **Data Pre-processing**
2. **Fitting the MLR model to the training set**
3. **Predicting the result of the test set**

**Step 1: Data Pre-processing**

The first step is data pre-processing, which involves the following steps:

* **Importing libraries**: We will import the necessary libraries to build the model.
* **Importing dataset**: We will import the dataset (50_CompList) containing all the variables.
* **Output**: We will get the dataset with five variables, including four continuous variables and one categorical variable (State).
* **Extracting dependent and independent variables**: We will extract the dependent variable (Profit) and independent variables (R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, and State).
* **Encoding dummy variables**: We will encode the categorical variable (State) using the LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder classes to create dummy variables.

**Code for Encoding Dummy Variables**

```
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder

# Encode the categorical variable (State)
le = LabelEncoder()
state_encoded = le.fit_transform(state)

# Create dummy variables using OneHotEncoder
ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
state_dummy = ohe.fit_transform(state_encoded.reshape(-1, 1))
```

**Output**

The encoded State column will be converted into dummy variables (0 and 1), with each dummy variable column corresponding to one State. We can check the output by comparing it with the original dataset.

**Splitting the Dataset into Training and Test Sets**

We will split the dataset into a training set and test set using the following code:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and test sets

**Training and Test Set Results**

From the above code, we obtained the training and test set results, with a difference of 0.0154 between the two scores.

**Step 1: Preparation for Backward Elimination**

**Importing Libraries**

We need to import the `statsmodels.formula.api` library, which is used for estimating various statistical models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

**Adding a Constant Term**

In our MLR equation, there is a constant term `b0`, which is not present in our matrix of features. We need to add it manually. We will add a column with values `x0 = 1` associated with the constant term `b0`. We will use the `numpy` library's `append` function to add this column, assigning a value of 1. The code for this is shown below.

**Output**

Executing this code adds a new column to our matrix of features, with all values equal to 1. We can verify this by checking the `x` dataset under the Variable Explorer option.

**Step 2: Backward Elimination**

**Creating a New Feature Vector**

We will create a new feature vector `x_opt` containing only the independent features that significantly affect the dependent variable.

**Choosing a Significant Level**

We will choose a significant level of 0.5 and fit the model with all possible predictors.

**Fitting the Model**

We will create a `regressor_OLS` object of the `statsmodels` library's `OLS` class and fit it using the `fit()` method.

**Comparing p-values**

We will use the `summary()` method to obtain a summary table of all values. The code for this is shown below.

**Output**

Executing this code produces a summary table. From the table, we can see the p-values of all variables. We will choose the highest p-value, which is for `x1` (0.953). Since this p-value is greater than the significant level, we will remove the `x1` variable (dummy variable) from the table and refit the model.

**The Importance of Polynomial Regression in Machine Learning**

Polynomial Regression is a crucial technique in Machine Learning that addresses the limitations of linear models when dealing with non-linear datasets. To understand the need for Polynomial Regression, consider the following points:

* When applying a linear model to a linear dataset, it produces accurate results, as seen in Simple Linear Regression.
* However, when applying the same model to a non-linear dataset without modification, it leads to a drastic output, resulting in:
	+ Increased loss function
	+ High error rate
	+ Decreased accuracy
* To overcome this issue, Polynomial Regression is necessary when data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion.

The following diagram illustrates the difference between linear and non-linear datasets:

In the diagram, a non-linear dataset is shown, where a linear model fails to cover most data points. In contrast, a curve, representative of the Polynomial Regression model, effectively covers most data points.

Data Pre-processing Step: The data pre-processing step will remain the same as in previous regression models, except for some changes. In the Polynomial Regression model, we will not use feature scaling, and also we will not split our dataset into training and test set. It has two reasons: The dataset contains very less information which is not suitable to divide it into a test and training set, else our model will not be able to find the correlations between the salaries and levels.In this model, we want very accurate predictions for salary, so the model should have enough information. The code for pre-processing step is given below: Explanation: In the above lines of code, we have imported the important Python libraries to import dataset and operate on it.Next, we have imported the dataset 'Position_Salaries.csv', which contains three columns (Position, Levels, and Salary), but we will consider only two columns (Salary and Levels).After that, we have extracted the dependent(Y) and independent variable(X) from the dataset. For x-variable, we have taken parameters as :,1:2, because we want 1 index(levels), and included :2 to make it as a matrix. Output: By executing the above code, we can read our dataset as: As we can see in the above output, there are three columns present (Positions, Levels, and Salaries). But we are only considering two columns because Positions are equivalent to the levels or may be seen as the encoded form of Positions. Here we will predict the output for level6.5because the candidate has 4+ years' experience as a regional manager, so he must be somewhere between levels 7 and 6. Building the Linear regression model: Now, we will build and fit the Linear regression model to the dataset. In building polynomial regression, we will take the Linear regression model as reference and compare both the results. The code is given below: In the above code, we have created the Simple Linear model usinglin_regsobject ofLinearRegressionclass and fitted it to the dataset variables (x and y). Output: Building the Polynomial regression model: Now we will build the Polynomial Regression model, but it will be a little different from the Simple Linear model. Because here we will usePolynomialFeaturesclass ofpreprocessinglibrary. We are using this class to add some extra features to our dataset. In the above lines of code, we have usedpoly_regs.fit_transform(x), because first we are converting our feature matrix into polynomial feature matrix, and then fitting it to the Polynomial regression model. The parameter value(degree= 2) depends on our choice. We can choose it according to our Polynomial features. After executing the code, we will get another matrixx_poly, which can be seen under the variable explorer option: Next, we have used another LinearRegression object, namelylin_reg_2, to fit ourx_polyvector to the linear model. Output: Visualizing the result for Linear regression: Now we will visualize the result for Linear regression model as we did in Simple Linear Regression. Below is the code for it: Output: In the above output image, we can clearly see that the regression line is so far from the datasets. Predictions are in a red straight line, and blue points are actual values. If we consider this output to predict the value of CEO, it will give a salary of approx. 600000$, which is far away from the real value. So we need a curved model to fit the dataset other than a straight line. Visualizing the result for Polynomial Regression Here we will visualize the result of Polynomial regression model, code for which is little different from the above model. Code for this is given below: In the above code, we have taken lin_reg_2.predict(poly_regs.fit_transform(x), instead of x_poly, because we want a Linear regressor object to predict the polynomial features matrix. Output: As we can see in the above output image, the predictions are close to the real values. The above plot will vary as we will change the degree. For degree= 3: If we change the degree=3, then we will give a more accurate plot, as shown in the below image. SO as we can see here in the above output image, the predicted salary for level 6.5 is near to 170K$-190k$, which seems that future employee is saying the truth about his salary. Degree= 4:Let's again change the degree to 4, and now will get the most accurate plot. Hence we can get more accurate results by increasing the degree of Polynomial. Predicting the final result with the Linear Regression model: Now, we will predict the final output using the Linear regression model to see whether an employee is saying truth or bluff. So, for this, we will use thepredict()method and will pass the value 6.5. Below is the code for it: Output: Predicting the final result with the Polynomial Regression model: Now, we will predict the final output using the Polynomial Regression model to compare with Linear model. Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see, the predicted output for the Polynomial Regression is 158862.45265153, which is much closer to real value hence, we can say that future employee is saying true.","gression**

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. The main steps involved in polynomial regression are:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: The data pre-processing step is similar to that of linear regression, except that feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and test sets are not necessary. This is because the dataset contains limited information, and the model needs to have enough information to make accurate predictions.
2. **Building the Linear Regression Model**: A linear regression model is built and fitted to the dataset to serve as a reference for comparison with the polynomial regression model.
3. **Building the Polynomial Regression Model**: A polynomial regression model is built by adding extra features to the dataset using the `PolynomialFeatures` class from the `preprocessing` library. The degree of the polynomial is chosen based on the desired level of complexity.
4. **Visualizing the Results**: The results of both linear and polynomial regression models are visualized to compare their performance.
5. **Predicting the Output**: The final output is predicted using both linear and polynomial regression models.

**Code**

The code for building and fitting the linear and polynomial regression models is as follows:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Position_Salaries.csv')

# Pre-process the data
X = df[['Levels']]
y = df['Salary']

# Build the linear regression model
lin_regs = LinearRegression()
lin_regs.fit(X, y)

# Build the polynomial regression model
poly_regs = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
x_poly = poly_regs.fit_transform(X)
lin_reg_2 = LinearRegression()
lin_reg_2.fit(x_poly, y)

# Visualize the results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, lin_regs.predict(X), 'r-')
plt.plot(X, lin_reg_2.predict(x_poly), 'b-')

**Evaluating Model Performance**

After completing a machine learning model, it is essential to assess its performance. This evaluation process is crucial for both Classification and Regression models. For Classification models, there are several methods to evaluate their performance:

**1. Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss)**

Log Loss, also known as Cross-Entropy Loss, is a widely used metric to evaluate the performance of a Classification model. It measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual output. A good binary Classification model should have a Log Loss value close to 0. The value of Log Loss increases as the predicted value deviates from the actual value. A lower Log Loss indicates higher accuracy.

For Binary Classification, the Cross-Entropy Loss can be calculated as:

Log Loss = - (y \* log(p) + (1-y) \* log(1-p))

where y is the actual output and p is the predicted output.

**2. Confusion Matrix**

A Confusion Matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a Classification model. It provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance, including the number of correct and incorrect predictions. The matrix consists of four main components:

| Predicted Class | Actual Class |
| --- | --- |
| Positive | True Positive (TP) |
| Positive | False Positive (FP) |
| Negative | False Negative (FN) |
| Negative | True Negative (TN) |

**3. AUC-ROC Curve**

The AUC-ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve) is a graphical representation of a Classification model's performance at different thresholds. It is used to evaluate the performance of multi-class Classification models. The curve is plotted with the True Positive Rate (TPR) on the Y-axis and the False Positive Rate (FPR) on the X-axis. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) represents the model's overall performance.

Logistic regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm that falls under the category of supervised learning techniques. Its primary function is to predict a categorical dependent variable based on a given set of independent variables.

**Output Prediction**

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable, which must be a categorical or discrete value. This can be represented as a binary outcome (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1, True/False), but instead of providing exact values, it outputs probabilistic values ranging from 0 to 1.

**Comparison to Linear Regression**

Logistic regression is similar to linear regression, except for its application. Linear regression is used for solving regression problems, whereas logistic regression is used for solving classification problems. In logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an ""S""-shaped logistic function that predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).

**Logistic Function**

The curve generated by the logistic function indicates the likelihood of an event occurring, such as whether cells are cancerous or not, or whether a mouse is obese or not based on its weight, etc.

**Significance and Applications**

Logistic regression is a significant machine learning algorithm because it can provide probabilities and classify new data using both continuous and discrete datasets. It can be used to classify observations using various types of data and easily determine the most effective variables used for classification.

**Visual Representation**

The following image illustrates the logistic function:

The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.In logistic regression, we use the concept of the threshold value, which defines the probability of either 0 or 1. Such as values above the threshold value tends to 1, and a value below the threshold values tends to 0.","ction is a mathematical function that maps predicted values to probabilities, converting any real value into a value within the range [0, 1].

**Logistic Regression Equation**

The Logistic Regression equation can be derived from the Linear Regression equation through a series of mathematical transformations. The steps to obtain the Logistic Regression equation are outlined below:

**Step 1: Linear Regression Equation**

The equation of a straight line can be written as:

y = β0 + β1x + ε

**Step 2: Logistic Regression Equation**

In Logistic Regression, the response variable y can only take values between 0 and 1. To accommodate this, we divide the Linear Regression equation by (1-y):

y / (1-y) = β0 + β1x + ε

**Step 3: Logarithmic Transformation**

To obtain a range of -∞ to +∞, we take the logarithm of the equation:

log(y / (1-y)) = log(β0 + β1x + ε)

**Final Logistic Regression Equation**

The resulting equation is the final form of the Logistic Regression equation:

log(y / (1-y)) = β0 + β1x

168,logistic-regression-in-machine-learning,https://www.javatpoint.com/logistic-regression-in-machine-learning,"To understand the implementation of Logistic Regression in Python, we will use the below example: Example:There is a dataset given which contains the information of various users obtained from the social networking sites. There is a car making company that has recently launched a new SUV car. So the company wanted to check how many users from the dataset, wants to purchase the car. For this problem, we will build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic regression algorithm. The dataset is shown in the below image. In this problem, we will predict thepurchased variable (Dependent Variable)by usingage and salary (Independent variables). Steps in Logistic Regression:To implement the Logistic Regression using Python, we will use the same steps as we have done in previous topics of Regression. Below are the steps: Data Pre-processing stepFitting Logistic Regression to the Training setPredicting the test resultTest accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)Visualizing the test set result. 1. Data Pre-processing step:In this step, we will pre-process/prepare the data so that we can use it in our code efficiently. It will be the same as we have done in Data pre-processing topic. The code for this is given below: By executing the above lines of code, we will get the dataset as the output. Consider the given image: Now, we will extract the dependent and independent variables from the given dataset. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have taken 2, 3 for x because our independent variables are age and salary, which are at index 2, 3. And we have taken 4 for y variable because our dependent variable is at index 4. The output will be: Now we will split the dataset into a training set and test set. Below is the code for it: The output for this is given below: For test set: For training set: In logistic regression, we will do feature scaling because we want accurate result of predictions. Here we will only scale the independent variable because dependent variable have only 0 and 1 values. Below is the code for it: The scaled output is given below: 2. Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set: We have well prepared our dataset, and now we will train the dataset using the training set. For providing training or fitting the model to the training set, we will import theLogisticRegressionclass of thesklearnlibrary. After importing the class, we will create a classifier object and use it to fit the model to the logistic regression. Below is the code for it: Output:By executing the above code, we will get the below output: Out5: Hence our model is well fitted to the training set. 3. Predicting the Test Result Our model is well trained on the training set, so we will now predict the result by using test set data. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have created a y_pred vector to predict the test set result. Output:By executing the above code, a new vector (y_pred) will be created under the variable explorer option. It can be seen as: The above output image shows the corresponding predicted users who want to purchase or not purchase the car. 4. Test Accuracy of the result Now we will create the confusion matrix here to check the accuracy of the classification. To create it, we need to import theconfusion_matrixfunction of the sklearn library. After importing the function, we will call it using a new variablecm. The function takes two parameters, mainlyy_true( the actual values) andy_pred(the targeted value return by the classifier). Below is the code for it: Output: By executing the above code, a new confusion matrix will be created. Consider the below image: We can find the accuracy of the predicted result by interpreting the confusion matrix. By above output, we can interpret that 65+24= 89 (Correct Output) and 8+3= 11(Incorrect Output). 5. Visualizing the training set result Finally, we will visualize the training set result. To visualize the result, we will useListedColormapclass of matplotlib library. Below is the code for it: In the above code, we have imported theListedColormapclass of Matplotlib library to create the colormap for visualizing the result. We have created two new variablesx_setandy_setto replacex_trainandy_train. After that, we have used thenm.meshgridcommand to create a rectangular grid, which has a range of -1(minimum) to 1 (maximum). The pixel points we have taken are of 0.01 resolution. To create a filled contour, we have usedmtp.contourfcommand, it will create regions of provided colors (purple and green). In this function, we have passed theclassifier.predictto show the predicted data points predicted by the classifier. Output:By executing the above code, we will get the below output: The graph can be explained in the below points: In the above graph, we can see that there are someGreen pointswithin the green region andPurple pointswithin the purple region.All these data points are the observation points from the training set, which shows the result for purchased variables.This graph is made by using two independent variables i.e.,Age on the x-axisandEstimated salary on the y-axis.Thepurple point observationsare for which purchased (dependent variable) is probably 0, i.e., users who did not purchase the SUV car.Thegreen point observationsare for which purchased (dependent variable) is probably 1 means user who purchased the SUV car.We can also estimate from the graph that the users who are younger with low salary, did not purchase the car, whereas older users with high estimated salary purchased the car.But there are some purple points in the green region (Buying the car) and some green points in the purple region(Not buying the car). So we can say that younger users with a high estimated salary purchased the car, whereas an older user with a low estimated salary did not purchase the car. The goal of the classifier: We have successfully visualized the training set result for the logistic regression, and our goal for this classification is to divide the users who purchased the SUV car and who did not purchase the car. So from the output graph, we can clearly see the two regions (Purple and Green) with the observation points. The Purple region is for those users who didn't buy the car, and Green Region is for those users who purchased the car. Linear Classifier: As we can see from the graph, the classifier is a Straight line or linear in nature as we have used the Linear model for Logistic Regression. In further topics, we will learn for non-linear Classifiers. Visualizing the test set result: Our model is well trained using the training dataset. Now, we will visualize the result for new observations (Test set). The code for the test set will remain same as above except that here we will usex_test and y_testinstead ofx_train and y_train. Below is the code for it: Output: The above graph shows the test set result. As we can see, the graph is divided into two regions (Purple and Green). And Green observations are in the green region, and Purple observations are in the purple region. So we can say it is a good prediction and model. Some of the green and purple data points are in different regions, which can be ignored as we have already calculated this error using the confusion matrix (11 Incorrect output). Hence our model is pretty good and ready to make new predictions for this classification problem.","ession in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide**

So for this identification, we can use the KNN algorithm, as it works on a similarity measure. Our KNN model will find the similar features of the new data set to the cats and dogs images and based on the most similar features it will put it in either cat or dog category.","eighbors (K-NN) algorithm is a fundamental machine learning technique based on supervised learning. It operates by assuming that the similarity between a new case or data point and existing cases is a reliable indicator of the new case's category. The algorithm stores all available data and classifies new data points based on their similarity to existing categories. This enables efficient classification of new data into well-suited categories using the K-NN algorithm.

K-NN can be applied to both regression and classification problems, although it is commonly used for classification tasks. As a non-parametric algorithm, K-NN does not make assumptions about the underlying data distribution. Instead, it is often referred to as a ""lazy learner"" because it does not learn from the training set immediately. Instead, it stores the dataset and performs an action on it at the time of classification.

During the training phase, the K-NN algorithm simply stores the dataset. When new data is encountered, the algorithm classifies it into a category that is most similar to the new data. For instance, consider an image of a creature that appears similar to both cats and dogs. To identify whether it is a cat or dog, the K-NN algorithm can be employed, as it relies on a similarity measure. The K-NN model will find the most similar features of the new data set to cat and dog images and categorize it accordingly.

The green points are for Purchased(1) and Red Points for not Purchased(0) variable.The graph is showing an irregular boundary instead of showing any straight line or any curve because it is a K-NN algorithm, i.e., finding the nearest neighbor.The graph has classified users in the correct categories as most of the users who didn't buy the SUV are in the red region and users who bought the SUV are in the green region.The graph is showing good result but still, there are some green points in the red region and red points in the green region. But this is no big issue as by doing this model is prevented from overfitting issues.Hence our model is well trained.Visualizing the Test set result:After the training of the model, we will now test the result by putting a new dataset, i.e., Test dataset. Code remains the same except some minor changes: such asx_train and y_trainwill be replaced byx_test and y_test.Below is the code for it: Output: The above graph is showing the output for the test data set. As we can see in the graph, the predicted output is well good as most of the red points are in the red region and most of the green points are in the green region. However, there are few green points in the red region and a few red points in the green region. So these are the incorrect observations that we have observed in the confusion matrix(7 Incorrect output).","m Implementation**

In this section, we will implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm using Python to improve the performance of the model. The problem description is as follows:

**Problem Statement**

A car manufacturer company wants to target users interested in buying a new SUV car. The company has a dataset containing user information from a social network. The dataset includes multiple features, but we will consider only the estimated salary and age as independent variables, and the purchased variable as the dependent variable.

**Steps to Implement K-NN Algorithm**

1. **Data Pre-processing**: The data pre-processing step remains the same as in Logistic Regression.
2. **Fitting K-NN Classifier to Training Data**: We will import the `KNeighborsClassifier` class from the `sklearn.neighbors` library and create a `Classifier` object with the following parameters:
	* `n_neighbors`: defines the required neighbors of the algorithm.
	* `metric='minkowski'`: decides the distance between points.
	* `p=2`: equivalent to the standard Euclidean metric.
3. **Predicting Test Result**: We will create a `y_pred` vector to predict the test set result.
4. **Creating Confusion Matrix**: We will create a confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier.
5. **Visualizing Training Set Result**: We will visualize the training set result using a scatter plot.
6. **Visualizing Test Set Result**: We will visualize the test set result using a scatter plot.

**Code**

The code for implementing the K-NN algorithm is as follows:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('purchased', axis=1), df['purchased'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Data pre-processing
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)
x_test = scaler.transform(x_test)

# Fitting K-NN classifier to the training data
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='minkowski', p=2)
knn.fit(x_train, y_train)

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. However, it is primarily employed for classification tasks in machine learning. The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the optimal decision boundary, also known as a hyperplane, that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes. This allows for accurate classification of new data points in the future.

**Key Concepts**

* **Hyperplane**: The decision boundary created by the SVM algorithm to separate classes.
* **Support Vectors**: The extreme points or vectors that help in creating the hyperplane.
* **Classification**: The process of assigning a new data point to a specific class based on the decision boundary.

**Example**

Consider a scenario where we want to create a model that can accurately identify whether a strange animal is a cat or dog. We can use the SVM algorithm to achieve this. First, we train our model with a large dataset of cat and dog images, allowing it to learn about their distinct features. Then, we test the model with the strange animal. The SVM algorithm creates a decision boundary between the cat and dog data and selects the extreme cases (support vectors). Based on these support vectors, the algorithm classifies the strange animal as a cat.

**Applications**

The SVM algorithm has various applications, including:

* Face detection
* Image classification
* Text categorization

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) Types**

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm can be categorized into two primary types:

**1. Linear SVM**

Linear SVM is designed for linearly separable data, where a dataset can be classified into two classes using a single straight line. In this scenario, the data is considered linearly separable, and the corresponding classifier is referred to as a Linear SVM classifier.

**2. Non-Linear SVM**

Non-Linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, where a dataset cannot be classified using a straight line. In this case, the data is considered non-linear, and the corresponding classifier is referred to as a Non-Linear SVM classifier.

And if there are 3 features, then hyperplane will be a 2-dimension plane. We always create a hyperplane that has a maximum margin, which means the maximum distance between the data points.

In n-dimensional space, multiple decision boundaries can be used to separate classes. However, the goal is to find the optimal decision boundary, known as the hyperplane, which enables accurate classification of data points. The dimensions of the hyperplane depend on the number of features present in the dataset. For instance, if there are two features, the hyperplane is a straight line, while with three features, it becomes a 2-dimensional plane.

**Maximum Margin Hyperplane**

To create an optimal hyperplane, we aim to achieve a maximum margin, which is the maximum distance between the data points and the hyperplane. This ensures that the hyperplane is as far away as possible from the data points, making it a robust classifier.

**Support Vectors**

The data points or vectors closest to the hyperplane, which affect its position, are referred to as Support Vectors. Since these vectors support the hyperplane, they are called Support Vectors. These vectors play a crucial role in determining the position and orientation of the hyperplane, making them essential for the classification process.

Suppose we have a dataset that has two tags (green and blue), and the dataset has two features x1 and x2. We want a classifier that can classify the pair(x1, x2) of coordinates in either green or blue. Consider the below image: So as it is 2-d space so by just using a straight line, we can easily separate these two classes. But there can be multiple lines that can separate these classes. Consider the below image: Hence, the SVM algorithm helps to find the best line or decision boundary; this best boundary or region is called as ahyperplane. SVM algorithm finds the closest point of the lines from both the classes. These points are called support vectors. The distance between the vectors and the hyperplane is called asmargin.

Non-Linear SVM: If data is linearly arranged, then we can separate it by using a straight line, but for non-linear data, we cannot draw a single straight line. Consider the below image: So to separate these data points, we need to add one more dimension. For linear data, we have used two dimensions x and y, so for non-linear data, we will add a third dimension z. It can be calculated as: By adding the third dimension, the sample space will become as below image: So now, SVM will divide the datasets into classes in the following way. Consider the below image: Since we are in 3-d Space, hence it is looking like a plane parallel to the x-axis. If we convert it in 2d space with z=1, then it will become as: Hence we get a circumference of radius 1 in case of non-linear data.

Predicting the test set result:Now, we will predict the output for test set. For this, we will create a new vector y_pred. Below is the code for it: After getting the y_pred vector, we can compare the result ofy_predandy_testto check the difference between the actual value and predicted value. Output:Below is the output for the prediction of the test set: Creating the confusion matrix:Now we will see the performance of the SVM classifier that how many incorrect predictions are there as compared to the Logistic regression classifier.

The function takes two parameters, mainlyy_true( the actual values) andy_pred(the targeted value return by the classifier). Below is the code for it: Output: As we can see in the above output image, there are 66+24= 90 correct predictions and 8+2= 10 correct predictions. Therefore we can say that our SVM model improved as compared to the Logistic regression model.

Visualizing the test set result: Output: By executing the above code, we will get the output as: As we can see in the above output image, the SVM classifier has divided the users into two regions (Purchased or Not purchased). Users who purchased the SUV are in the red region with the red scatter points. And users who did not purchase the SUV are in the green region with green scatter points.

**Non-Linear SVM**

If the data is not linearly separable, we cannot separate it using a single straight line. To separate non-linear data, we need to add another dimension. For linear data, we used two dimensions (x and y), so for non-linear data, we add a third dimension (z). This can be calculated as:

By adding the third dimension, the sample space becomes:

217,machine-learning-interview-questions,https://www.javatpoint.com/machine-learning-interview-questions,"Both bias and variance are errors. Bias is an error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. It can lead to the model under-fitting the data, making it hard to have high predictive accuracy and generalize the knowledge from the training set to the test set. Variance is an error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm. It leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in the training data, which can lead the model to overfit the data. To optimally reduce the number of errors, we will need to tradeoff bias and variance.","n Machine Learning: Bias and Variance**

In machine learning, two primary errors occur: bias and variance. **Bias** is an error resulting from flawed or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. This can lead to underfitting, making it challenging to achieve high predictive accuracy and generalize knowledge from the training set to the test set.

**Variance**, on the other hand, is an error caused by excessive complexity in the learning algorithm. This leads to high sensitivity to variations in the training data, resulting in overfitting, where the model becomes overly specialized to the training data.

To minimize errors, it is essential to strike a balance between bias and variance, a process known as **bias-variance tradeoff**. By optimizing this tradeoff, we can develop more accurate and effective machine learning models.
