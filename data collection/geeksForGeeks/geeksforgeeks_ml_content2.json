In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.",

It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies.

It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data."

            "This process makes use of the relationships between data points and propagates labels to unmarked ones via labeled ones. Picture a social network platform where some of the users have been marked as fans of sports (labeled data). Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a \"sports\" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels. This method is beneficial when the data points are themselves connected to each other and this connection can be exploiting during labelling of new data."

            "Reinforcement learning takes a dissimilar approach from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Different from supervised learning or just plain discovery of hidden patterns, reinforcement learning adopt an agent as it interacts with the surrounding and learns. This agent is a learning one which develops via experiment and error, getting rewarded for the desired actions and punished for the undesired ones. The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards."

            "Visualize a robot trying to find its way through a maze. It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast, SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy."

            "In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods."
