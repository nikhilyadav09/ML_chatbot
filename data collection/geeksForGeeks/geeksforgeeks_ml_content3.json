        "1. Supervised Models": [
            "Supervised learning is the study of algorithms that use labeled data in which each data instance has a known category or value to which it belongs. This results in the model to discover the relationship between the input features and the target outcome."
        ],
        "1.1 Classification": [
            "The classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.",
            "Common Classification Algorithms:",
            "Logistic Regression: A very efficient technique for the classification problems of binary nature (two types, for example, spam/not spam).",
            "Support Vector Machine (SVM): Good for tasks like classification, especially when the data has a large number of features.",
            "Decision Tree: Constructs a decision tree having branches and proceeds to the class predictions through features.",
            "Random Forest: The model generates an \"ensemble\" of decision trees that ultimately raise the accuracy and avoid overfitting (meaning that the model performs great on the training data but lousily on unseen data).",
            "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns a label of the nearest neighbors for a given data point."
        ],
        "1.2 Regression": [
            "Regression algorithms are about forecasting of a continuous output variable using the input features as their basis. This value could be anything such as predicting real estate prices or stock market trends to anticipating customer churn (how likely customers stay) and sales forecasting. Regression models make the use of features to understand the relationship among the continuous features and the output variable. That is, they use the pattern that is learned to determine the value of the new data points.",
            "Common Regression Algorithms",
            "Linear Regression: Fits depth of a line to the data to model for the relationship between features and the continuous output.",

            "Visualize being given a basket of fruits with no labels on them. The fruits clustering algorithms are to group them according to the inbuilt similarities. Techniques like K-means clustering are defined by exact number of clusters (\"red fruits\" and \"green fruits\") and then each data point (fruit) is assigned to the cluster with the highest similarity within based on features (color, size, texture). Contrary to this, hierarchical clustering features construction of hierarchy of clusters which makes it more easy to study the system of groups. Spatial clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) detects groups of high-density data points, even in those areas where there is a lack of data or outliers."
        ],
        "2.2 Dimensionality Reduction": [
            "Sometimes it is difficult to both visualize and analyze the data when you have a large feature space (dimensions). The purpose of dimensionality reduction methods is to decrease the dimensions needed to maintain the key features. Dimensions of greatest importance are identified by principal component analysis (PCA), which is the reason why data is concentrated in fewer dimensions with the highest variations. This speeds up model training as well as offers a chance for more efficient visualization. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) also resembles PCA but it is made for classification tasks where it concentrates on dimensions that can differentiate the present classes in the dataset."
        ],
        "2.3 Anomaly Detection": [
            "Unsupervised learning can also be applied to find those data points which greatly differ than the majorities. The statistics model may identify these outliers, or anomalies as signaling of errors, fraud or even something unusual. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) makes a comparison of a given data point's local density with those surrounding it. It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies. Isolation Forest is the one which uses different approach, which is to recursively isolate data points according to their features. Anomalies usually are simple to contemplate as they often necessitate fewer steps than an average normal point."

        "3. Semi-Supervised Model": [
            "Besides, supervised learning is such a kind of learning with labeled data that unsupervised learning, on the other hand, solves the task where there is no labeled data. Lastly, semi-supervised learning fills the gap between the two. It reveals the strengths of both approaches by training using data sets labeled along with unlabeled one. This is especially the case when labeled data might be sparse or prohibitively expensive to acquire, while unlabeled data is undoubtedly available in abundance."
        ],
        "3.1 Generative Semi-Supervised Learning": [
            "Envision having a few pictures of cats with labels and a universe of unlabeled photos. The big advantage of generative semi-supervised learning is its utilization of such a scenario. It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data."

        "3.2 Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning": [
            "This process makes use of the relationships between data points and propagates labels to unmarked ones via labeled ones. Picture a social network platform where some of the users have been marked as fans of sports (labeled data). Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a \"sports\" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels. This method is beneficial when the data points are themselves connected to each other and this connection can be exploiting during labelling of new data."
        ],
        "4. Reinforcement learning Models": [
            "Reinforcement learning takes a dissimilar approach from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Different from supervised learning or just plain discovery of hidden patterns, reinforcement learning adopt an agent as it interacts with the surrounding and learns. This agent is a learning one which develops via experiment and error, getting rewarded for the desired actions and punished for the undesired ones. The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards."
        ],
        "4.1 Value-based learning:": [
            "Visualize a robot trying to find its way through a maze. It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast, SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy."
        ],
        "4.2 Policy-based learning:": [
            "In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods."

This is typically achieved using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the model's parameters in the direction that reduces the objective function.",
            "Generalization: Once the model is trained, it is evaluated on a separate set of data called the validation or test set to assess its performance on new, unseen data. The model's ability to perform well on data it hasn't seen before is known as generalization.",

        "Step 1: Data Collection for Machine Learning": [
            "Data collection is a crucial step in the creation of a machine learning model, as it lays the foundation for building accurate models. In this phase of machine learning model development, relevant data is gathered from various sources to train the machine learning model and enable it to make accurate predictions. The first step in data collection is defining the problem and understanding the requirements of the machine learning project. This usually involves determining the type of data we need for our project like structured or unstructured data, and identifying potential sources for gathering data.",
            "Once the requirements are finalized, data can be collected from a variety of sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, and manual data entry. It is crucial to ensure that the collected data is both relevant and accurate, as the quality of the data directly impacts the generalization ability of our machine learning model. In other words, the better the quality of the data, the better the performance and reliability of our model in making predictions or decisions."

        "Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning": [
            "Preprocessing and preparing data is an important step that involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for training and testing for our models. This phase aims to clean i.e. remove null values, and garbage values, and normalize and preprocess the data to achieve greater accuracy and performance of our machine learning models.",
            "As Clive Humby said, \"Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be used.\" This quote emphasizes the importance of refining data before using it for analysis or modeling. Just like oil needs to be refined to unlock its full potential, raw data must undergo preprocessing to enable its effective utilization in ML tasks. The preprocessing process typically involves several steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables i.e. converting into numerical, scaling numerical features, and feature engineering. This ensures that the model's performance is optimized and also our model can generalize well to unseen data and finally get accurate predictions."

        "Step 4: Training Your Machine Learning Model": [
            "In this phase of building a machine learning model, we have all the necessary ingredients to train our model effectively. This involves utilizing our prepared data to teach the model to recognize patterns and make predictions based on the input features. During the training process, we begin by feeding the preprocessed data into the selected machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm then iteratively adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual target values in the training data. This optimization process often employs techniques like gradient descent.",
            "As the model learns from the training data, it gradually improves its ability to generalize to new or unseen data. This iterative learning process enables the model to become more adept at making accurate predictions across a wide range of scenarios."

            "As we have trained our model, our next step is to optimize our model more. Tuning and optimizing helps our model to maximize its performance and generalization ability. This process involves fine-tuning hyperparameters, selecting the best algorithm, and improving features through feature engineering techniques. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the training process begins and control the behavior of the machine learning model. These are like learning rate, regularization and parameters of the model should be carefully adjusted.",

            "During model deployment, it's essential to ensure that the system can handle high user loads, operate smoothly without crashes, and be easily updated. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes help make this process easier by packaging the model in a way that makes it easy to run on different computers and manage efficiently. Once deployment is done our model is ready to predict new data, which involves feeding unseen data into the deployed model to enable real-time decision making."
